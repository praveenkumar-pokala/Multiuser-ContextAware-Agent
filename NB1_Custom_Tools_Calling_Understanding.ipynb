        "#Tool calling is how LLMs evolve from *talking* to *doing*.\n",

        "### 1. Why LLMs Need Tools\n",
        "LLMs can think, but can they *act*?  \n",
        "We’ll explore how tools let them reach beyond text — to search, calculate, and interact with the real world.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Build a Custom Tool from a Real API\n",
        "We’ll turn a real API endpoint into an LLM tool — step by step.  \n",
        "You’ll see how to define its name, description, input schema, and function.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. How Tools Are Invoked\n",
        "Behind every tool call is a reasoning loop — the model plans, names the right tool, and prepares the arguments.  \n",
        "But remember: it’s not executing anything yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. The Hidden Truth: LLMs Don’t Run Tools\n",
        "LLMs only decide **what** to call and **with what arguments**.  \n",
        "It’s the agent (or human) that actually runs the tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Meet the Agent — The Real Executor\n",
        "The agent is the LLM’s partner — it interprets the model’s plan, executes the tools, and returns results.  \n",
        "It’s the bridge between *thinking* and *doing*.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. Native Tool Calling in Modern Models\n",
        "Models like ChatGPT or Claude are fine-tuned for tool calling — they natively output structured tool calls.  \n",
        "We’ll see how effortless that feels.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 8. When Models Don’t Have Native Support\n",
        "Even if a model doesn’t support tool calling, smart prompting can simulate it.  \n",

            "\n",
            "Large language models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input they receive. These models are built using deep learning techniques, particularly neural networks with many layers, which allow them to process vast amounts of text data and learn complex patterns in language.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are some key characteristics of large language models:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Scale and Capacity: LLMs are characterized by their large size, often containing billions or even trillions of parameters. This size allows them to capture intricate patterns and nuances in language, enabling them to perform a wide range of language-related tasks.\n",
            "2. Training Data: LLMs are trained on extensive datasets that include text from books, websites, articles, and other written material. This diverse training data allows them to learn grammar, facts, context, and even some degree of reasoning.\n",
            "3. Capabilities: LLMs can perform a variety of tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, question answering, and creative writing. They can also generate coherent and contextually relevant text, making them useful for applications like chatbots, content creation, and automated reporting.\n",
            "4. Contextual Understanding: LLMs are adept at understanding context, which allows them to generate more accurate and relevant responses. They can take into account the surrounding text and adjust their output accordingly, making them versatile tools for interactive applications.\n",
            "5. Transfer Learning: One of the advantages of LLMs is their ability to transfer learning across different tasks. Once trained on a large corpus of text, they can be fine-tuned for specific applications with relatively smaller datasets, improving efficiency and effectiveness.\n",
            "6. Challenges and Limitations: Despite their capabilities, LLMs have limitations, such as generating biased or incorrect information if the training data contains biases or errors. They can also produce plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers, and they may lack true understanding beyond pattern recognition.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, large language models are powerful AI tools that can perform a wide range of language-based tasks by leveraging their extensive training on diverse datasets. Their ability to understand and generate human-like text makes them valuable for numerous applications, although ethical and practical considerations must be taken into account when deploying them.\n",
            "\n",
            "## What are the limitations of LLMs?\n",
            "\n",
            "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in natural language processing and generation, but they also have several limitations that users and developers need to be aware of. Here are some of the key limitations:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Lack of Understanding: Despite their ability to generate human-like text, LLMs do not truly understand the content they process. They rely on patterns in the data rather than genuine comprehension, which can lead to plausible but incorrect or nonsensical outputs.\n",
            "2. Bias and Fairness: LLMs can inherit and amplify biases present in the data they are trained on. If the training data includes biased or prejudiced language, the model might produce outputs that reflect these biases, leading to ethical concerns and potentially harmful outcomes.\n",
            "3. Over-reliance on Training Data: LLMs are only as good as the data they are trained on. They lack real-time knowledge and cannot update their understanding of the world beyond what they have seen during training, which can result in outdated or incorrect information.\n",
            "4. Difficulty with Complex Reasoning: While LLMs can handle simple reasoning tasks, they struggle with complex logical reasoning and problem-solving that require deep understanding and integration of diverse concepts.\n",
            "5. Resource Intensive: Training and deploying LLMs require significant computational resources and energy, which can be costly and environmentally impactful. This can limit access to such technology to well-funded organizations and create barriers for smaller entities.\n",
            "6. Potential for Misuse: LLMs can be used to generate misleading or harmful content, such as deepfakes, disinformation, and automated spam. Their ability to produce convincing text raises concerns about misuse and the spread of false information.\n",
            "7. Limited Contextual Awareness: While LLMs can process and generate text based on a given context, they may lose coherence in longer texts or complex dialogues that require maintaining context over multiple interactions.\n",
            "8. Dependence on User Input: The quality of an LLM's output is highly dependent on the quality of the input prompt. Ambiguous or poorly structured prompts can lead to unsatisfactory responses.\n",
            "9. Ethical and Legal Concerns: The use of LLMs raises questions about intellectual property rights, privacy, and accountability, especially when they are used to generate content based on copyrighted materials or personal data.\n",
            "10. Safety Concerns: LLMs might generate inappropriate or unsafe content, especially if not properly filtered or monitored. This poses challenges in applications like customer support or content moderation.\n",
            "11. To address these limitations, developers and researchers are continuously working on improving LLMs through techniques like fine-tuning, bias mitigation, and incorporating human feedback. Understanding these limitations is crucial for deploying LLMs responsibly and effectively.\n",

            "## How LLM Learns: with Charlie the Computer (AI Simplified Series)\n",
            "\n",
            "## How are LLMs trained?\n",
            "\n",
            "Training large language models (LLMs) involves several steps and techniques designed to enable these models to understand and generate human-like text. Here’s an overview of the process:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Data Collection: The first step in training an LLM is collecting a vast and diverse dataset. This dataset typically includes text from a wide range of sources, such as books, articles, websites, and social media. The goal is to gather enough data to cover various topics, writing styles, and contexts to make the model versatile in understanding language.\n",
            "2. Data Preprocessing: Once the data is collected, it is preprocessed to make it suitable for training. This involves cleaning the data by removing irrelevant content, formatting the text uniformly, tokenizing the text into smaller units (such as words or subwords), and creating input-output pairs that the model will learn from.\n",
            "3. Model Architecture: LLMs are typically based on neural network architectures, such as transformers. The transformer architecture is particularly popular for LLMs because it can process large amounts of data efficiently and capture long-range dependencies in text through mechanisms like self-attention.\n",
            "4. Training Process: The training process involves feeding the preprocessed data into the model and adjusting the model’s parameters to minimize the difference between the model’s predictions and the actual data. This is done through a process called backpropagation, which adjusts the weights of the neural network based on the errors in predictions.\n",
            "   1. Unsupervised Pre-training: LLMs are often pre-trained using unsupervised learning on large datasets. The model learns to predict the next word in a sentence or fill in missing words, which helps it understand language structure and context.\n",
            "   2. Fine-tuning: After pre-training, the model may be fine-tuned on a smaller, task-specific dataset. Fine-tuning helps the model adapt to specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis or question answering, by focusing on examples relevant to those tasks.\n",
            "5. Evaluation and Iteration: Throughout the training process, the model’s performance is evaluated on validation datasets. These datasets are separate from the training data and help assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. Based on the evaluation results, the model may be adjusted or further trained to improve performance.\n",
            "6. Hyperparameter Tuning: During training, various hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and model size, are adjusted to optimize performance. Hyperparameter tuning is often done through experimentation and can significantly impact the model’s effectiveness.\n",
            "7. Deployment: Once trained and evaluated, the model is deployed for use in applications. During deployment, additional techniques like pruning, quantization, or distillation might be used to make the model more efficient and reduce computational requirements.\n",
            "8. Training LLMs requires substantial computational resources and time due to the complexity and size of these models. However, the result is a powerful language model capable of understanding and generating text across a wide range of applications.\n",

Claude excels at [natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing) and is multimodal: it accepts text, audio and visual inputs and can answer questions, summarize documents and generate long-form text, diagrams, animations, program code and more.\n\nClaude adheres to Anthropic’s *Constitutional AI* philosophy: a code of ethical norms that the firm believes differentiates Claude from competing AI models such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. The principles of Constitutional AI are focused on AI safety, designed to guide Claude toward providing more helpful responses while avoiding harmful behaviors such as [AI bias](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-bias).\n\nClaude 3, released in May 2024, includes one free and two premium AI [chatbots](https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots).\n\n* **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** underpins the free version of Claude AI. Its emphasis on speed enables it to quickly process user queries and other tasks requiring urgent data retrieval. According to Anthropic, Claude 3.5 Sonnet is twice as fast as Claude 3 Opus, one of the two premium offerings.\n\n* **Claude 3 Opus** is one of two Claude models currently available to Claude Pro users. It provides in-depth document processing and content generation services, specializing in complex tasks. While slower than Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Opus runs a lower risk of [hallucinations](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-hallucinations): when an AI model provides incorrect information as though it is factually correct.\n\n* **Claude 3 Haiku** is the second premium Claude offering. It’s the smallest and fastest of the three and is ideal for use in summarizing long documents, real-time customer service and simple text generation.\n\n## What is Claude used for?\n\nEach of the three Claude 3 models has its own specialized use cases. In general, people can use Claude AI to help with a wide range of tasks, including:\n\n* Question-answering and research\n* Proofreading and editing\n* Document summarization, including PDFs and Word documents\n* Text and content generation\n* Language translation\n* Business plan creation\n* Image and audio processing\n* Code snippet generation and review\n\nUnlike Claude 2 and 1, Claude 3 is multimodal: it can process image and audio content alongside text-based prompts. For example, Claude 3 can generate e-commerce product descriptions based on images. While Claude 3 cannot generate nontext content on its own, its multimodal integration is one of several new features that allow it to compete with GPT-4.\n\n## How does Claude AI work?\n\nLike Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude family of AI systems are based on the transformer architecture of neural network. But unlike its competitors, Claude applies the principles of Constitutional AI to govern its behavior.\n\n* **Transformer models** excel at drawing connections between distant words in a user input sequence, enabling them to better understand context and generate long-form replies.\n\n* **Constitutional AI** is a guiding set of harm reduction principles designed to make Claude more beneficial with less risk.\n\n### What are transformer models?\n\nTransformers are a type of AI model built for high-performance natural language processing. They work by applying complex mathematical algorithms to statistically predict the most likely response to a user query. The [workflow](https://www.ibm.com/topics/workflow) can be divided into four basic steps.\n\nThe transformer breaks up a user query into **tokens**. Each token represents either a whole word or a portion of a word. AI model pricing is typically represented as the cost per token. Claude Pro’s context window is 200,000 tokens[1](#footnotes1), meaning it can process user queries of up to 200,000 tokens in length.\n\n1. Each token is plotted into a three-dimensional vector space via mathematical processes. Tokens that are assessed as more similar in meaning are plotted closer together in space, aiding LLMs in understanding user inputs. The result of this process is called a **vector embedding**.\n2. Transformers such as Claude and GPT-4 apply **self-attention mechanisms** to self-direct resources on the most relevant portions of a user query and process context.\n3. The model applies probabilistic algorithms to generate the **most likely response** to an input. AI models such as Claude don’t actually “know” anything—rather, they combine their training data with advanced statistics to yield the most probable outcomes to prompts.\n\n### What is Constitutional AI?\n\nConstitutional AI[2](#footnote2) is a set of [AI ethics](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-ethics) and safety principles created by AI startup Anthropic. When designing Claude, Anthropic sourced input from approximately 1,000 people, asking them to vote on and suggest rules for ethical [generative AI](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) operation and [responsible AI](https://www.ibm.com/topics/responsible-ai) use. The final assembly of rules formed the basis of Claude’s training process.\n\nThe first three rules of Constitutional AI are:\n\n* Choose the response that is the least dangerous or hateful.\n* Choose the response that is as reliable, honest, and close to the truth as possible.\n* Choose the response that best conveys clear intentions.\n\nWhere other models have their content reviewed by human trainers in a process called [reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/rlhf), Claude’s was trained with RLHF as well as a second AI model. Reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) tasked the “trainer” model with comparing Claude’s behavior against Constitutional AI and correcting it accordingly.\n\nRLAIF [automates](https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation) the behavior-adjustment portion of the training process, making it cheaper and more efficient to encourage ethical behavior. The intended result is that Claude would [fine-tune](https://www.ibm.com/topics/fine-tuning) itself, learning to avoid harmful prompts while generating helpful replies to prompts it deems answerable.\n\n## Who is Anthropic AI?\n\nAnthropic is an AI startup founded in 2021 by several ex-OpenAI researchers and executives, including siblings Daniela and Dario Amodei. Amazon and Google have each invested billions in USD into the company, while OpenAI continues to enjoy backing from Microsoft.\n\nThe Amodei siblings parted ways with OpenAI in 2021, the year before OpenAI released GPT-3.5. This is the same AI model that continues to power the free ChatGPT AI tool today. Along with other former OpenAI researchers, the Amodei siblings founded Anthropic AI and began work on what would become Claude AI.\n\nAnthropic’s defining feature is their stated approach to ethical AI, represented by the Constitutional AI training process.\n\n## The benefits of Claude vs ChatGPT and Gemini\n\nWhen releasing Claude 3, Anthropic AI conducted a series of LLM benchmarking tests to evaluate their models against those of their two primary competitors: OpenAI and Google. Both in those tests and otherwise, Claude demonstrated several key advantages:\n\n* Larger context window\n* Strong performance in many tests\n* No input or output data retention\n\n### Larger context window\n\nAble to field prompts of up to 200,000 tokens—approximately 350 pages of text—Claude can remember and use more information when creating relevant answers. By comparison, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o limit users to 128,000 tokens.\n\nClaude’s ability to retain more information allows users to create detailed, data-packed prompts. The more data contained in the input sequence, the more relevant an AI model’s answer can be.\n\n### Strong performance in many tests\n\nWhen Anthropic tested Claude 3 against GPT-4 and Gemini 1.0[3](#footnote3), Claude 3 Opus was the top performer in all selected evaluation benchmarks. Gemini 1.0 Ultra came out on top in four of the six vision tests, though the Claude family of models performed comparably.\n\nHowever, GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 were not included in the testing pool. When revealing GPT-4o in May 2024[4](#footnote4), OpenAI conducted benchmarking that saw their new flagship model beat Claude 3 Opus in five out of six conducted tests.\n\n### No input or output data retention\n\nUsers concerned about data privacy might appreciate Anthropic’s data retention policy[5](#footnote5): they state that all user inputs and outputs are deleted after 30 days. Google’s Gemini for Google Cloud data policy[6](#footnote6) says that the company will not train its models with user prompts.\n\nBy comparison, OpenAI can retain and use user data[7](#footnote7) to further train their models. Google’s Gemini Apps policies[8](#footnote8)permit the company to retain user data unless the user manually deactivates this option.\n\n## Claude’s disadvantages\n\nWhile Claude’s overall performance is strong when compared to the competition, it also has a handful of weaknesses that can delay its acceptance by the greater population.\n\n* Limited image generation\n* No internet browsing\n\n### Limited image generation\n\nCompared to GPT-4o, Claude is less able to create images. While Claude can produce interactive [flowcharts](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/flowchart), [entity relationship diagrams](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/entity-relationship-diagram) and graphs, it stops short of full image generation.\n\n### No internet browsing\n\nDue to Microsoft’s integration with Bing, GPT-4 is able to search the internet when answering user queries. While Claude is regularly updated with new training data, its knowledge base is always several months behind until Anthropic elects to open Claude up to the internet in the same way.\n\nLink copied\n\n[Ebook\n\nHow to choose the right foundation model\n\nLearn how to choose the right approach in preparing datasets and employing foundation models.\n\nRead the ebook](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-52620)\n\n## Resources\n\n[AI models\n\nExplore IBM Granite\n\nDiscover IBM® Granite™, our family of open, performant and trusted AI models, tailored for business and optimized to scale your AI applications.

Definition, Types, Responsibilities, and Future\\n\\n![What is an Agent](https://devpumas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/what-is-an-agent.jpg)\\n\\n## **Introduction to Agents**\\n\\nAn **agent** is a person or entity authorized to act on behalf of a **principal**, creating a **fiduciary relationship** built on trust and responsibility. Through **agency law**, an **attorney**, **stockbroker**, **real estate agent**, or even an **insurance agent** can carry out important **real estate transactions**, financial decisions, or negotiations. Agents follow strict **confidentiality agreements** and must respect **contract law**, fulfilling duties like the **duty of loyalty**, **duty of care**, and **duty of disclosure**. From business contracts to AI-driven systems, agents shape decisions that influence everyday life.\\n\\n## **Understanding the Principal-Agent Relationship**\\n\\nThe **principal-agent relationship** allows a **principal** to give authority to an **agent** to act on their behalf. This can be through an **agency agreement**, a **power of attorney**, or even through an **agency by necessity** when urgent action is required. Such relationships are central to modern transactions, from **real estate deals** to corporate contracts.\\n\\nThis relationship depends on the **confidentiality duty of the agent**. For example, an **attorney** cannot share client secrets, and a **stockbroker** must keep investment strategies private. If these rules are broken, it creates a **conflict of interest in agency** and may lead to **agent liability**. Strong trust is what makes this relationship valuable in both personal and business life.\\n\\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeB-XJq_UoUlOWAltWBxVt_FonCAKXupRYah9ip947T4TK061hA_M5YB-2VBjTUsPMZPp85uPsObvk1fYgYaVAbAc7DJGjIBR9SndQKRm8lZWqwWncv6zdrQryXu0W0KyFJ1V4PJQ?key=DDRyD0sdRM-oo2tMcIjyqg)\\n\\n## **Types of Agents**\\n\\nThere are several types of agents, and their roles differ depending on the authority given. A **general agent vs special agent** is a common comparison. A general agent has broad powers to manage multiple tasks for the **principal**, while a special agent is limited to one specific duty. A **universal agent authority** is rare but gives the agent almost complete control over the **principal’s** matters.\\n\\nIn practice, there are many everyday agents. A **talent agent** promotes artists, a **travel agent** books holidays, a **stockbroker as agent** manages trades, and an **insurance agent** sells policies. Each role is defined by **express authority** (clearly given powers) or **implied authority** (powers assumed by the nature of the role).\\n\\n**Comparison of Agent Types**\\n\\n|  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| **Type of Agent** | **Scope of Authority** | **Example** |\\n| General Agent | Broad, ongoing tasks | Business manager |\\n| Special Agent | Limited to one action | Real estate sale |\\n| Universal Agent | Almost unlimited | Holder of **power of attorney** |\\n\\n### **Duties and Responsibilities of an Agent**\\n\\nAn **agent** must follow several duties under **fiduciary duty**. The **duty of loyalty** requires agents to prioritize the **principal’s** interests over their own. The **duty of care** ensures they act with skill and caution, while the **duty of obedience** means following instructions. The **duty of disclosure** requires agents to share important facts with the **principal**.\\n\\nAgents must also maintain the **duty of separation**, which means keeping their own finances separate from the **principal’s**. This prevents problems with **separation of accounts in agency**. For example, if a **commission-based agent** mixes personal funds with the **principal’s**, it may lead to disputes, legal action, and **agent liability**.\\n\\n### **Legal and Financial Liabilities of Agents**\\n\\nUnder **agency law** and **contract law**, agents face serious responsibilities. If an agent violates **confidentiality agreements**, accepts a **material benefit** without approval, or engages in **usurpation of principal rights**, they can be held legally responsible. Courts often impose fines, order compensation, or even cancel contracts due to such violations.\\n\\nPayment for agents also matters. Some receive fixed **agent compensation**, while others earn as **commission-based agents**. If payments are unclear, disputes may arise. Transparency is important to avoid mistrust, and both **express authority** and **implied authority** must be respected in financial transactions.\\n\\n## **How Agents Are Used in Real Life**\\n\\nAgents are part of many industries in the USA. A **registered agent** is legally required for corporations to handle lawsuits and state filings. An **estate planning agent** helps people write wills and manage assets. A **travel agent** assists with trips, and an **insurance agent** ensures coverage against risks.\\n\\nThere are also cases of **agency by necessity**, where an **[agent](https://devpumas.com/ai-chatbots-in-2025/)** acts without prior approval in emergencies. For instance, if a shipping company makes urgent decisions to save goods at sea, it acts as an agent by necessity. These examples show that agents remain important in daily life, business, and law.\\n\\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfLCYdJc5USQsxPQq2YSbkcl5h0b6AXpHpqh9fCIW3qeWPD4E3czLhGTxb99-uB1fuWTTfEBa-WbmIeD-CUMDsSKv3F3bWg4VWMjRGnMWX--v64eEzUyk6LFSXncgXTrkD2KFAb?key=DDRyD0sdRM-oo2tMcIjyqg)\\n\\n## **Agents in Business**\\n\\nIn business, agents are central to success. A **legal agent** negotiates contracts, manages deals, and ensures compliance with **contract law**. A **licensed agent** provides expertise in industries like finance and insurance, helping companies avoid mistakes and legal issues.\\n\\nCorporations depend heavily on **registered agents** to receive legal notices, tax documents, and lawsuits. Without them, companies may face fines or lose credibility. Agents in the corporate world combine knowledge of **[agency law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/agency)** with practical skills to ensure businesses run smoothly.\\n\\n### **Benefits of Hiring an Agent**\\n\\nHiring an **agent** provides clear benefits. For individuals, it saves time and ensures expertise. A **real estate agent** simplifies property deals, while an **attorney** protects legal rights. For companies, hiring a **licensed agent** or **registered agent** ensures compliance with state and federal laws.\\n\\nAnother benefit is trust. Since agents work under a **fiduciary relationship**, they follow duties of honesty and loyalty. This makes principals confident that their interests are protected. As one legal scholar stated, “Without agents, modern business would collapse under the weight of its own complexity.”\\n\\n## **Challenges and Risks of Agents**\\n\\nWhile agents provide benefits, they also come with risks. An agent may fail to meet the **duty of care**, misuse authority, or breach **confidentiality agreements**. If this happens, the **principal** may face financial loss, legal issues, or damaged reputation.\\n\\nDisputes often arise over **agent compensation** or unclear **agency agreements**. Problems like **competition conflict** or **conflict of interest in agency** can also occur. This is why principals must choose trustworthy agents, often requiring them to be a **licensed agent** or **registered agent**.\\n\\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe7EnnFbw0xuylCfkwr10NhC4dHzLvjc8m2y7Z_KmLZnRu3iiNaTNysHcBtxBkKJcRA83CIF7hKvwd14yQcmvNHSwFw7q_HLwQNGCufggHqbDeAEFNEE_bZ2G4aSlh631ThcFKPAg?key=DDRyD0sdRM-oo2tMcIjyqg)\\n\\n## **Future of Agents**\\n\\nThe future of agents will evolve with technology. Some roles, like **travel agents**, are being replaced by digital platforms. However, roles that require trust, like **attorneys**, **real estate agents**, and **estate planning agents**, will remain vital. These jobs depend on **fiduciary duty**, which technology cannot fully replace.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence may help agents by automating routine tasks, but the **fiduciary relationship** still requires human judgment. As laws adapt, the balance between digital tools and human trust will shape the future of agents in business and society.\\n\\n### **FAQS**\\n\\n**1. What is the definition of an agent?** An **agent** is someone who acts on behalf of a **principal** to perform tasks, make decisions, or manage responsibilities.\\n\\n**2. What is an agent in AI?** In **AI**, an agent is a system that observes its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve goals.\\n\\n**3. What did the agent mean?** The word **agent** means “one who acts for another,” coming from the Latin word *agere* meaning “to do.”\\n\\n**4. What are the four types of agents?** The four types are **general agent, special agent, universal agent, and agency by necessity.**\\n\\n**5. What is Agents’ full name?** The term **agent** has no full form; it simply means a representative acting on another’s behalf\\n\\n## **Conclusion**\\n\\nAn **agent** is more than just a representative. They carry legal, financial, and ethical responsibilities under **agency law** and **contract law**. Their relationship with the **principal** is built on **fiduciary duty**, which includes honesty, loyalty, and care.\\n\\nFrom **attorneys** and **stockbrokers** to **insurance agents**, **estate planning agents**, and **registered agents**, their importance is clear. While the future will bring automation, agents will still be necessary to handle **confidentiality agreements**, protect principals, and manage complex transactions. Understanding their role, benefits, and risks allows us to see why agents remain a cornerstone of modern life.\\n\\n##### Get fresh Content From DevPumas\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61551846008128&mibextid=LQQJ4d)\\n\\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/DevPumas)\\n\\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devpumas/)\\n\\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/devpumas_/)\\n\\n### I need help with...\\n\\n* [Mobile Application Development](https://devpumas.com/mobile-app/)\\n\\n* [Software Product Development](https://devpumas.com/software-product-development/)\\n\\n* [Artificial Intelligence](https://devpumas.com/artificial-intelligence/)\\n\\n* [WordPress Development](https://devpumas.com/wordpress-development/)\\n\\n* [Web Scrapping](https://devpumas.com/web-scrapping-2/)\\n\\n##### Latest Posts\\n\\n* [AI Receptionist for Business: A Complete Guide for 2025](https://devpumas.com/ai-receptionist-for-business/)\\n* [Outsource Software Development Guide for Business Owners 2025](https://devpumas.com/outsource-software-development/)\\n* [Web Design 2025: The Ultimate Guide to Stunning, High-Converting Websites](https://devpumas.com/web-design/)\\n* [E-Commerce Workflow Automation: Everything You Need to Know in 2025](https://devpumas.com/e-commerce-workflow-automation/)\\n* [Web Application Development: A Complete Beginner’s Guide in 2025](https://devpumas.com/web-application-development/)\\n\\n![Devpumas Logo](https://devpumas.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Asset-4-300x56.png)\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61551846008128&mibextid=LQQJ4d)\\n\\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/devpumas_/)\\n\\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devpumas/?viewAsMember=true)\\n\\n[Wordpress](https://www.upwork.com/agencies/devpumas/)\\n\\n##### Quick Links\\n\\n* [Home](https://devpumas.com/)\\n* [About us](https://devpumas.com/about/)\\n* [Services](https://devpumas.com/devpumas-services/)\\n* [Portfolio](https://devpumas.com/portfolio/)\\n* [Blog](https://devpumas.com/blog/)\\n* [Dedicated Team](https://devpumas.com/dedicated-team/)\\n* [Contact Us](https://devpumas.com/contactus/)\\n\\n* [Home](https://devpumas.com/)\\n* [About us](https://devpumas.com/about/)\\n* [Services](https://devpumas.com/devpumas-services/)\\n* [Portfolio](https://devpumas.com/portfolio/)\\n* [Blog](https://devpumas.com/blog/)\\n* [Dedicated Team](https://devpumas.com/dedicated-team/)\\n* [Contact Us](https://devpumas.com/contactus/)\\n\\n### CANADA\\n\\n* 6660 Kennedy Road Unit 201 Mississauga, ON L5T 2M9\\n\\n### PAKISTAN\\n\\n* Sitara Technopark.

At the core of many AI systems are intelligent agents, autonomous entities that make decisions and perform tasks based on their environment.\\n\\nThese agents can range from simple rule-based systems to advanced learning systems powered by [large language models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs) that adapt and improve over time.\\n\\n[AI agents](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents) are classified based on their level of intelligence, decision-making processes and how they interact with their surroundings to reach wanted outcomes. Some agents operate purely on predefined rules, while others use learning algorithms to refine their behavior.\\n\\nThere are 5 main types of AI agents: simple reflex agents, model-based reflex agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents and learning agents. Each type has distinct strengths and applications, ranging from basic automated systems to highly adaptable AI models.\\n\\nAll 5 types can be deployed together as part of a multi-agent system, with each agent specializing in handling the part of the task for which they are best suited.\\n\\nThink Newsletter\\n\\n### Join over 100,000 subscribers who read the latest news in tech\\n\\nStay up to date on the most important—and intriguing—industry trends on AI, automation, data and beyond with the Think newsletter.\\xa0See the\\xa0[IBM Privacy Statement](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/privacy).\\n\\n### Thank you!

Refer to our\\xa0[IBM Privacy Statement](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/privacy)\\xa0for more information.\\n\\nhttps://www.ibm.com/us-en/privacy\\n\\n## Simple reflex agents\\n\\nA simple reflex agent is the most basic type of AI agent, designed to operate based on direct responses to environmental conditions. These agents follow predefined rules, known as condition-action rules, to make decisions without considering past experiences or future consequences.\\n\\nReflex agents apply current perceptions of the environment through sensors and take action based on a fixed set of rules.\\n\\nFor example, a thermostat is a simple reflex agent that turns on the heater if the temperature drops below a certain threshold and turns it off when the wanted temperature is reached. Similarly, an automatic traffic light system changes signals based on traffic sensor inputs, without remembering past states.\\n\\nSimple reflex agents are effective in structured and predictable environments where the rules are well-defined. However, they struggle in dynamic or complex scenarios that require memory, learning or long-term planning.\\n\\nBecause they do not store past information, they can repeatedly make the same mistakes if the predefined rules are insufficient for handling new situations.\\n\\n## Model-based reflex agents\\n\\nA model-based reflex agent is a more advanced version of the simple reflex agent. While it still relies on condition-action rules to make decisions, it also incorporates an internal model of the world. This model helps the agent track the current state of the environment and understand how past interactions might have impacted it, allowing it to make more informed decisions.\\n\\nUnlike simple reflex agents, which respond solely to current sensory input, model-based reflex agents use their internal model to reason about the environment\\'s dynamics and make decisions accordingly.\\n\\nFor instance, a robot navigating a room might not just react to obstacles in its immediate path but also consider its previous movements and the locations of obstacles that it has already passed.\\n\\nThis ability to track past states enables model-based reflex agents to function more effectively in partially observable environments. They can handle situations where the context needs to be remembered and used for future decisions, making them more adaptable than simpler agents.\\n\\nHowever, while model-based agents improve flexibility, they still lack the advanced reasoning or learning capabilities required for truly complex problems in dynamic environments.\\n\\n## Goal-based agents\\n\\nA goal-based reflex agent extends the capabilities of a simple reflex agent by incorporating a proactive, goal-oriented approach to problem-solving.\\n\\nUnlike reflex agents that react to environmental stimuli with predefined rules, goal-based agents consider their ultimate objectives and use planning and reasoning to choose actions that move them closer to achieving their goals.\\n\\nThese agents operate by setting a specific goal, which guides their actions. They evaluate different possible actions and select the one most likely to help them reach that goal.\\n\\nFor instance, a robot designed to navigate a building might have a goal of reaching a specific room. Rather than reacting to immediate obstacles only, it plans a path that minimizes detours and avoids known obstacles, based on a logical assessment of available choices.\\n\\nThe goal-based agent\\'s ability to reason allows it to act with greater foresight compared to simpler reflex agents. It considers future states and their potential impact on reaching the goal.\\n\\nHowever, goal-based agents can still be relatively limited in complexity compared to more advanced types, as they often rely on preprogrammed strategies or decision trees for evaluating goals.\\n\\nGoal-based reflex agents are widely used in robotics, autonomous vehicles and complex simulation systems where reaching a clear objective is crucial, but real-time adaptation and decision-making are also necessary.\\n\\n## Utility-based agents\\n\\nA utility-based reflex agent goes beyond simple goal achievement by using a utility function to evaluate and select actions that maximize overall benefit.\\n\\nWhile goal-based agents choose actions based on whether they fulfill a specific objective, utility-based agents consider a range of possible outcomes and assign a utility value to each, helping them determine the most optimal course of action. This allows for more nuanced decision-making, particularly in situations where multiple goals or tradeoffs are involved.\\n\\nFor example, a self-driving car might face a decision to choose between speed, fuel efficiency and safety when navigating a route. Instead of just aiming to reach the destination, it evaluates each option based on utility functions, such as minimizing travel time, maximizing fuel economy or ensuring passenger safety. The agent selects the action with the highest overall utility score.\\n\\nAn e-commerce company might employ a utility-based agent to optimize pricing and recommend products. The agent evaluates various options, such as sales history, customer preferences and inventory levels to make informed decisions on how to price items dynamically.\\n\\nUtility-based reflex agents are effective in dynamic and complex environments, where simple binary goal-based decisions might not be sufficient. They help balance competing objectives and adapt to changing conditions, ensuring more intelligent, flexible behavior.\\n\\nHowever, creating accurate and reliable utility functions can be challenging, as it requires careful consideration of multiple factors and their impact on decision outcomes.\\n\\n## Learning agents\\n\\nA learning agent improves its performance over time by adapting to new experiences and [data](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/dataset). Unlike other AI agents, which rely on predefined rules or models, learning agents continuously update their behavior based on feedback from the environment. This allows them to enhance their decision-making abilities and perform better in dynamic and uncertain situations.\\n\\nLearning agents typically consist of 4 main components:\\n\\n1. **Performance element**: Makes decisions based on a knowledge base.\\n2. **Learning element**: Adjusts and improves the agent\\'s knowledge based on feedback and experience.\\n3. **Critic**: Evaluates the agent\\'s actions and provides feedback, often in the form of rewards or penalties.\\n4. **Problem generator**: Suggests exploratory actions to help the agent discover new strategies and improve its learning.\\n\\nFor example, in [reinforcement learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/reinforcement-learning), an agent might explore different strategies, receiving rewards for correct actions and penalties for incorrect ones. Over time, it learns which actions maximize its reward and refine its approach.\\n\\nLearning agents are highly flexible and capable of handling complex, ever-changing environments. They are useful in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics and [virtual assistants](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/virtual-agent) that assist human agents in [customer support](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/customer-service-future).\\n\\nThe ability to learn from interactions makes learning agents valuable for applications in fields such as persistent [chatbots](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chatbots) and social media, where [natural language processing](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing) (NLP) analyzes user behavior to predict and optimize content recommendations.\\n\\n## Multi-agent systems\\n\\nAs AI systems become more intricate, the need for hierarchical agents arises. These agents are designed to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable subtasks, making it easier to handle complex problems in real-world scenarios. Higher-level agents focus on overarching goals, while lower-level agents handle more specific tasks.\\n\\nAn [AI orchestration](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-orchestration) that integrates the different types of AI agents can make for a highly intelligent and adaptive [multi-agent system](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/multiagent-system) capable of managing complex tasks across multiple domains.\\n\\nSuch a system can operate in real time, responding to dynamic environments while continuously improving its performance based on past experiences.\\n\\nFor example, in a smart factory, a smart management system might involve reflexive autonomous agents handling basic [automation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/automation) by responding to sensor inputs with predefined rules. These agents help ensure that machinery reacts instantly to environmental changes, such as shutting down a conveyor belt if a safety hazard is detected.\\n\\nMeanwhile, model-based reflex agents maintain an internal model of the world, tracking the internal state of machines and adjusting their operations based on past interactions, such as recognizing maintenance needs before failure occurs.\\n\\nAt a higher level, goal-based agents drive the factory’s specific goals, such as optimizing production schedules or reducing waste. These agents evaluate possible actions to determine the most effective way to achieve their objectives.\\n\\nUtility-based agents further refine this process by considering multiple factors, such as energy consumption, cost efficiency and production speed, selecting actions that maximize expected utility.\\n\\nFinally, learning agents continuously improve factory operations through reinforcement learning and [machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning)\\xa0(ML) techniques. They analyze data patterns, adapt [workflows](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/workflow) and suggest innovative strategies to optimize manufacturing efficiency.\\n\\nBy integrating all 5 types of AI agents, this AI-powered orchestration enhances decision-making processes, streamlines resource allocation and minimizes human intervention, leading to a more intelligent and autonomous industrial system.\\n\\nAs [agentic AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai) continues to evolve, advancements in [generative AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/generative-ai)\\xa0(gen AI) will enhance the capabilities of AI agents across various industries. AI systems are becoming increasingly adept at handling complex use cases and improving [customer experiences](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-customer-experience).\\n\\nWhether in [e-commerce](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-in-ecommerce), healthcare or robotics, AI agents are optimizing [workflows](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-workflow), automating processes and enabling organizations to solve problems faster and more efficiently.\\n\\n##\\n\\nTechsplainers | Podcast | Types of AI agents\\n\\n### 🔊 Listen: Types of AI agents\\n\\nFollow Techsplainers:

He boldly declared that the ultimate technology race revolves around developing the top AI agent.\\n\\n“You’ll never go to a search site or Amazon again,” he said.\\n\\nAI agents–the virtual assistants powered by artificial intelligence, help automate processes, generate insights, and optimize performance.\\n\\nThese agents transcend traditional voice-based virtual assistants and can act as employees or partners to help achieve goals.\\n\\nBut not all AI agents are alike!\\n\\nSome are simple, some complex, some proactive, and some utility-oriented. Some learning-oriented, some fixed.\\n\\nIn this blog, we will explore the different types of AI agents and their possible applications in various sectors.\\n\\nUnlock the power of AI agents for your business with Simform. Get [expert advice](https://www.simform.com/contact/) from our consultants and leverage our [AI/ML services](https://www.simform.com/services/gen-ai-ml-development/) to automate, enhance, optimize and innovate your business like never before!\\n\\n## Types of AI Agents\\n\\n[Agents in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.simform.com/blog/agents-in-artificial-intelligence/) can be categorized into different types based on how agent’s actions affect their perceived intelligence and capabilities, such as:\\n\\n* Simple reflex agents\\n* Model-based agents\\n* Goal-based agents\\n* Utility-based agents\\n* Learning agents\\n* Hierarchical agents\\n\\nBy understanding the characteristics of each type of agent, it is possible to improve their performance and generate better actions. Let’s have a detailed overview of the types of AI agent.\\n\\n### 1. Simple Reflex Agent\\n\\nA simple reflex agent is an AI system that follows pre-defined rules to make decisions. It only responds to the current situation without considering the past or future ramifications.\\n\\nA simple reflex agent is suitable for environments with stable rules and straightforward actions, as its behavior is purely reactive and responsive to immediate environmental changes.\\n\\n#### **![Simple Reflex Agent](https://www.simform.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Simple-Reflex-Agent.png)**\\n\\n#### **How does it work?**\\n\\nA simple reflex agent executes its functions by following the condition-action rule, which specifies what action to take in a certain condition.\\n\\n#### **Example**\\n\\nA rule-based system developed to support automated customer support interactions. The system can automatically generate a predefined response containing instructions on resetting the password if a customer’s message contains keywords indicating a password reset.\\n\\n#### **Advantages of simple reflex agents**\\n\\n* Easy to design and implement, requiring minimal computational resources\\n* Real-time responses to environmental changes\\n* Highly reliable in situations where the sensors providing input are accurate, and the rules are well designed\\n* No need for extensive training or sophisticated hardware\\n\\n#### **Limitations of simple reflex agents**\\n\\nHere are the limitations of the simple reflex agent:\\n\\n* Prone to errors if the input sensors are faulty or the rules are poorly designed\\n* Have no memory or state, which limits their range of applicability\\n* Unable to handle partial observability or changes in the environment they have not been explicitly programmed for\\n* Limited to a specific set of actions and cannot adapt to new situations\\n\\n### 2. Model-based Reflex Agent\\n\\nA model-based reflex performs actions based on a current percept and an internal state representing the unobservable word. It updates its internal state based on two factors:\\n\\n* How the world evolves independently of the agent\\n* How does the agent’s action affect the world\\n\\nA cautionary model-based reflex agent is a variant of a model-based reflex agent that also considers the possible consequences of its actions before executing them.\\n\\n#### ![Model-based Reflex Agent](https://www.simform.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Model-based-Reflex-Agent.png)\\n\\n#### How does it work?\\n\\nA model-based reflex agent follows the condition-action rule, which specifies the appropriate action to take in a given situation. But unlike a simple reflex agent, a model-based agent also employs its internal state to assess the condition during the decision and action process.\\n\\nThe model-based reflex agent operates in four stages:\\n\\n1. **Sense:** It perceives the current state of the world with its sensors.\\n2. **Model:** It constructs an internal model of the world from what it sees.\\n3. **Reason:** It uses its model of the world to decide how to act based on a set of predefined rules or heuristics.\\n4. **Act:** The agent carries out the action that it has chosen.\\n\\n#### Example\\n\\nOne of the finest examples of a cautionary model-based reflex agent is [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/).\\n\\nAmazon Bedrock is a service that uses foundational models to simulate operations, gain insights, and make informed decisions for effective planning and optimization.\\n\\nBy relying on various models, Bedrock gains insights, predicts outcomes, and makes informed decisions. It continuously refines its models with real-world data, allowing it to adapt and optimize its operations.\\n\\nAmazon Bedrock then plans for different scenarios and selects optimal strategies through simulations and adjustments to model parameters.\\n\\n#### Advantages of model-based reflex agents\\n\\n* Quick and efficient decision-making based on their understanding of the world\\n* Better equipped to make accurate decisions by constructing an internal model of the world\\n* Adaptability to changes in the environment by updating their internal models\\n* More informed and strategic choices by using its internal state and rules to determine the condition\\n\\n#### Disadvantages of model-based reflex agents\\n\\n* Building and maintaining models can be computationally expensive\\n* The models may not capture the real-world environment’s complexity very well\\n* Models cannot anticipate all potential situations that may arise\\n* Models need to be updated often to stay current\\n* Models may pose challenges in terms of interpretation and comprehension\\n\\n### 3. Goal-based Agents\\n\\nGoal-based agents are [AI agents](https://www.simform.com/blog/ai-agent/) that use information from their environment to achieve specific goals. They employ search algorithms to find the most efficient path towards their objectives within a given environment.\\n\\nThese agents are also known as rule-based agents, as they follow predefined rules to accomplish their goals and take specific actions based on certain conditions.\\n\\nGoal-based agents are easy to design and can handle complex tasks. They can be used in various applications like robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing.\\n\\nUnlike basic models, a goal-based agent can determine the optimal course of decision-making and action-taking processes depending on its desired outcome or goal.\\n\\n#### ![Goal-based Agent](https://www.simform.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Goal-based-Agent.png)\\n\\n#### How does it work?\\n\\nGiven a plan, a goal-based agent attempts to choose the best strategy to achieve the goals, It then uses search algorithms and heuristics to find the efficient path to the goal.\\n\\nThe working pattern of the goal-based agent can be divided into five steps:\\n\\n1. **Perception:** The agent perceives its environment using sensors or other input devices to collect information about its surroundings.\\n2. **Reasoning:** The agent analyzes the information collected and decides on the best course of action to achieve its goal.\\n3. **Action:** The agent takes actions to achieve its goal, such as moving or manipulating objects in the environment.\\n4. **Evaluation:** After taking action, the agent evaluates its progress towards the goal and adjusts its actions, if necessary.\\n5. **Goal Completion:** Once the agent has achieved its goal, it either stops working or begins working on a new goal.\\n\\n#### Example\\n\\nWe can say that [Google Bard](https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/) is a goal-based agent. No doubt, it is also a learning agent.\\n\\nAs a goal-based agent, it has a goal or objective to provide high-quality responses to user queries. It chooses its actions that are likely to assist users in finding the information they seek and achieving their desired goal of obtaining accurate and helpful responses.\\n\\n#### Advantages of goal-based agents\\n\\n* Simple to implement and understand\\n* Efficient for achieving a specific goal\\n* Easy to evaluate performance based on goal completion\\n* It can be combined with other AI techniques to create more advanced agents\\n* Well-suited for well-defined, structured environments\\n* It can be used for various applications, such as robotics, game AI, and autonomous vehicles.\\n\\n#### Disadvantages of goal-based agents\\n\\n* Limited to a specific goal\\n* Unable to adapt to changing environments\\n* Ineffective for complex tasks that have too many variables\\n* Requires significant domain knowledge to define goals\\n\\n#### Explore the comprehensive Google Bard guide!\\n\\n[Read More](https://www.simform.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-google-bard/)\\n\\n### 4. Utility-based Agents\\n\\nUtility-based agents are AI agents that make decisions based on maximizing a utility function or value. They choose the action with the highest expected utility, which measures how good the outcome is.\\n\\nThis helps them deal with complex and uncertain situations more flexibly and adaptively. Utility-based agents are often used in applications where they have to compare and select among multiple options, such as resource allocation, scheduling, and game-playing.\\n\\n#### **![Utility-based Agent](https://www.simform.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Utility-based-Agent.png)**\\n\\n#### **How does it work?**\\n\\nA utility-based agent aims to choose actions that lead to a high utility state. To achieve this, it needs to model its environment, which can be simple or complex.\\n\\nThen, it evaluates the expected utility of each possible outcome based on the probability distribution and the utility function.\\n\\nFinally, it selects the action with the highest expected utility and repeats this process at each time step.\\n\\n#### **Example**\\n\\n[Anthropic Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude), an AI tool whose goal is to help cardmembers maximize their rewards and benefits from using cards, is a utility-based agent.\\n\\nBecause to achieve its goal, it employs a utility function to assign numerical values representing success or happiness to different states (situations that cardmembers face, such as purchasing, paying bills, redeeming rewards, etc.). And then compares the outcome of different actions in each state and trade-off decisions based on their utility values.\\n\\nFurthermore, it uses heuristics and AI techniques to simplify and improve decision-making.\\n\\n#### **Advantages of utility-based agents**\\n\\n* Handles a wide range of decision-making problems\\n* Learns from experience and adjusts their decision-making strategies\\n* Offers a consistent and objective framework for decision-making\\n\\n#### **Disadvantages of utility-based agents**\\n\\n* Requires an accurate model of the environment, failing to do so results in decision-making errors\\n* Computationally expensive and requires extensive calculations\\n* Does not consider moral or ethical considerations\\n* Difficult for humans to understand and validate\\n\\n### 5. Learning Agents\\n\\nAn AI learning agent is a software agent that can learn from past experiences and improve its performance. It initially acts with basic knowledge and adapts automatically through machine learning.\\n\\nThe learning agent comprises four main components:\\n\\n* **Learning Element:** It is responsible for learning and making improvements based on the experiences it gains from its environment.\\n* **Critque:** It provides feedback to the learning element by the agent’s performance for a predefined standard.\\n* **Performance Element:** It selects and executes external actions based on the information from the learning element and the critic.\\n* **Problem Generator:** It suggests actions to create new and informative experiences for the learning element to improve its performance.\\n\\n#### **![Learning Agent](https://www.simform.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Learning-Agent.png)**\\n\\n#### **How does it work?**\\n\\nAI learning agents follow a cycle of observing, learning, and acting based on feedback. They interact with their environment, learn from feedback, and modify their behavior for future interactions.\\n\\nHere’s how the cycle works:\\n\\n* **Observation:** The learning agent observes its environment through sensors or other inputs.\\n* **Learning:** The agent analyzes data using algorithms and statistical models, learning from feedback on its actions and performance.\\n* **Action:** Based on what it has learned, the agent acts in its environment to decide how to behave.\\n* **Feedback:** The agent receives feedback about their actions and performance through rewards, penalties, or environmental cues.\\n* **Adaptation:** Using feedback, the agent changes its behavior and decision-making processes, updating its knowledge and adapting to its environment.\\n\\nThis cycle repeats over time, allowing the agent to continuously improve its performance and adapt to changing circumstances.\\n\\n#### **Example**\\n\\nA good example of a learning agent program is AutoGPT, created by Significant Gravitas.\\n\\nImagine you want to purchase a smartphone. So, you give [AutoGPT](https://dataconomy.com/2023/04/13/what-is-autogpt-and-how-to-use-ai-agents/) a prompt to conduct market research on the top ten smartphones, providing insights on their pros and cons.\\n\\nOnce given this task, AutoGPT analyzes the pros and cons of the top ten smartphones by exploring various websites and sources. It evaluates the authenticity of websites using a sub-agent program. Finally, it generates a detailed report summarizing the findings and listing the pros and cons of the top ten smartphone companies.\\n\\n#### **Advantages of learning agents**\\n\\n* The agent can convert ideas into action based on AI decisions\\n* Learning intelligent agents can follow basic commands, like spoken instructions, to perform tasks\\n* Unlike classic agents that perform predefined actions, learning agents can evolve with time\\n* AI agents consider utility measurements, making them more realistic\\n\\n#### **Disadvantages of learning agents**\\n\\n* Prone to biased or incorrect decision-making\\n* High development and maintenance costs\\n* Requires significant computing resources\\n* Dependence on large amounts of data\\n* Lack of human-like intuition and creativity\\n\\n### 6. Hierarchical Agents\\n\\nHierarchical agents are structured in a hierarchy, with high-level agents overseeing lower-level agents. However, the levels may differ based on the complexity of the system.\\n\\nHierarchical agents are useful in various applications such as robotics, manufacturing, and transportation. They excel in coordinating and prioritizing multiple tasks and sub-tasks.\\n\\n#### **How does it work?**\\n\\nHierarchical agents work just like a corporate organization. They organize tasks in a structured hierarchy consisting of different levels, wherein higher-level agents supervise and decompose goals into smaller tasks.\\n\\nSubsequently, lower-level agents execute these tasks and provide progress reports.\\n\\nIn the case of complex systems, there may be intermediate-level agents who coordinate the activities of lower-level agents with higher ones.\\n\\n#### **Example**\\n\\n[UniPi](https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/04/unipi-learning-universal-policies-via.html), by Google, is an innovative hierarchical AI agent that utilizes text and video as a universal interface, enabling it to learn diverse tasks across various environments.\\n\\nUniPi comprises a high-level policy that generates instructions and demonstrations and a low-level policy that executes tasks. The high-level policy adapts to various environments and tasks, while the low-level policy learns through imitation and reinforcement learning.\\n\\nThis hierarchical setup enables UniPi to combine high-level reasoning and low-level execution effectively.\\n\\n#### **Advantages of hierarchical agents**\\n\\n* Hierarchical agents offer resource efficiency by assigning tasks to the most suitable agents and avoiding duplication of effort.\\n* The hierarchical structure enhances communication by establishing clear lines of authority and direction.\\n* Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) improves agent decision-making by reducing action complexity and enhancing exploration. It employs high-level actions to simplify the problem and facilitate agent learning.\\n* Hierarchical decomposition offers the benefit of minimizing computational complexity by representing the overall problem more concisely and reusable.\\n\\n#### **Disadvantages of hierarchical agents**\\n\\n* Complexity arises when using hierarchies for problem-solving.\\n* Fixed hierarchies limit adaptability in changing or uncertain environments, hindering the agent’s ability to adjust or find alternatives.\\n* Hierarchical agents follow a top-down control flow, which can cause bottlenecks and delays even if lower-level tasks are ready.\\n* Hierarchies may lack reusability across different problem domains, requiring the time-consuming and expertise-dependent creation of new hierarchies for each domain.\\n* Training hierarchical agents is challenging due to the need for labeled training data and careful algorithmic design. Applying standard machine learning techniques to improve performance becomes difficult due to the complexity involved.\\n\\n## Real-life examples of AI agents\\n\\nA few real-life examples of AI agents showcase AI’s diverse applications, including natural language processing and robotics. By exploring these examples, you can gain a deeper understanding of how AI is transforming industries and improving our daily lives:\\n\\n1. **Gemini:** [Gemini AI](https://singularityhub.com/2023/07/02/heres-why-google-deepminds-gemini-algorithm-could-be-next-level-ai/) is Google’s next-generation large language model (LLM) that uses reinforcement learning inspired by AlphaGo. This LLM involves rewarding positive behavior and correcting mistakes to improve problem-solving skills. The technique allows the software to learn independently through actions and feedback from its environment without human supervision.\\n2. **AI Sandbox:** Meta has launched the [AI Sandbox](https://aisandbox.dev/), an ad playground for advertisers to explore new generative AI-powered tools. It includes alternative text variations, various background generation, and image cropping for Facebook and Instagram ads. These features empower brands to create diverse ad copies, generate unique assets effortlessly, and design visually appealing content that fits different formats, like social media posts and short videos.\\n3. **Speak AI**: [Speak AI](https://speakai.co/) offers automated transcription services that convert audio and video into text. It provides an embeddable recorder for capturing recordings and supports popular integrations to simplify the capture process. Users can ask questions and receive meaningful responses using pre-designed speech prompts. Additionally, Speak AI offers various integration options, such as Zapier, Google Chrome Extension, Zoom integration, Vimeo integration, etc., to automate workflows.\\n4. **Camel AGI**: [Camel AGI](https://camelagi.thesamur.ai/) is an agent framework that uses role-based playing to guide chat agents toward task completion while maintaining consistency with human intentions. It can improve dialogue systems, create interactive gaming characters, simulate expert discussions, and tackle complex problems in various fields. It can also be used to investigate conversational language models.\\n5. **Zendesk AI**: [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/in/newsroom/articles/zendesk-ai/#georedirect) unveiled an AI solution for intelligent CX featuring advanced bots, agent assistance, and intelligent triage. These AI capabilities enhance the service experience, enabling smarter conversations that promptly resolve customer issues. For instance, suggest responses and detect customer intent, leaving agents prepared and refreshed.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAs AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect AI agents to become more autonomous and able to make decisions independently, with minimal human intervention. They can automate customer service, predict demand and trends, optimize production processes, and more.\\n\\nThe scope of AI agents in [different industries](https://www.simform.com/blog/applications-of-nlp/) is vast and promising.\\n\\nHowever, it’s crucial to consider ethics and use AI agents responsibly and beneficially for your enterprise.\\n\\nSo, choose wisely and embrace the power of AI agents for your enterprise.\\n\\n## Want to build intelligent applications?\\n\\nDevelop smart applications with our AI/ML development services.\\n\\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e97d97b4d4f5198549684304a47bbd8927e07a10c6580dba411688f258d19fe9?s=290&d=mm&r=g)\\n\\n### [Hiren Dhaduk](https://www.simform.com/author/hiren-simform/ \"Posts by Hiren Dhaduk\")\\n\\nHiren is CTO at Simform with an extensive experience in helping enterprises and startups streamline their business performance through data-driven innovation.\\n\\n1. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/08f8d6c9606ac374c4f1595b80fbf2ca2ec4f83c6ae2ad4a5dd12a010db87562?s=40&d=mm&r=g)\\n\\n   #### Kalpesh patil\\n\\n   March 16, 2024\\n\\n   Great article loved it.

Learn about agent types, duties, and liabilities.\\n13 min read\\n\\nupdated on October 07, 2025*\\n\\n## Key Takeaways\\n\\n* Definition of an Agent and Agency: An agent is a person authorized to act on behalf of a principal in legal or business matters. Agency is the legal relationship between the agent and principal.\\n* Types of Agents: Includes general agents, special agents, sub-agents, co-agents, and brokers, each with specific duties and limitations.\\n* Authority of Agents: Can be express, implied, or apparent, affecting their ability to bind the principal to contracts.\\n* Liability Considerations: Agents may be held personally liable under certain conditions, including exceeding their authority or committing fraud.\\n* Duties of Agents and Principals: Includes loyalty, obedience, and full disclosure from agents, while principals must compensate and indemnify agents.\\n* Agency Dissolution: Can occur through mutual agreement, revocation, fulfillment of purpose, or by operation of law.\\n* Regulation of Agency Relationships: Legal requirements vary depending on the type of agency, jurisdiction, and applicable contracts.\\n* Industry-Specific Applications: Agency relationships are widely used in real estate, finance, insurance, and employment law.\\n\\n## Agent\\n\\n**Definition**\\n\\n1. **A person who performs services for another person under an express or implied agreement and who is subject to the other\\'s control or right to control the manner and means of performing the services.** The other person is called a principal. One may be an agent without receiving compensation for services. The agency agreement may be oral or written.\\n2. The person to whom a power of attorney is given. An agent has authority to act on behalf of the grantor, as specified by the grantor in a power of attorney document.\\n\\n## Types of Agents\\n\\nAgents can be categorized based on the scope of their authority and the nature of their responsibilities:\\n\\n* **General Agent:** Authorized to conduct all business for the principal in a particular area or field (e.g., a property manager).\\n* **Special Agent:** Appointed for a specific transaction or purpose, such as a real estate agent.\\n* **Sub-Agent:** A person appointed by an agent to perform duties under the original agent’s authority.\\n* **Co-Agent:** Two or more agents working together under the same principal, sharing responsibilities.\\n* **Broker:** Facilitates transactions between two parties, typically in real estate, insurance, or financial markets.\\n\\nEach type of agent operates under different legal constraints, and their powers may be limited or broad, depending on the agency agreement.\\n\\n## Agency\\n\\n**Contracts**\\n\\n**An agreement, express , or implied, by which one of the parties, called the principal, confides to the other, denominated the agent, the management of some business; to be transacted in his name, or on his account, and by which the agent assumes to do the business and to render an account of it.** As a general rule, whatever a man do by himself, except in virtue of a delegated authority, he may do by an agent. Hence the maxim qui facit per alium facit per se.\\n\\nWhen the agency is express, it is created either by deed, or in writing not by deed, or verbally without writing. When the agency is not express, it may be inferred from the relation of the parties and the nature of the employment without any proof of any express appointment.\\n\\nThe agency must be antecedently given, or subsequently adopted; and in the latter case there must be an act of recognition, or an acquiescence in the act of the agent, from which a recognition may be fairly implied.\\n\\n## Creation of Agency Relationships\\n\\nAgency relationships can be established in multiple ways, depending on the agreement between the principal and agent:\\n\\n1. **Express Agreement:** A direct contract, either written or oral, where both parties agree to the agent\\'s authority.\\n2. **Implied Agency:** Based on the behavior and actions of the parties rather than a formal agreement.\\n3. **Apparent Authority:** When a principal’s actions cause third parties to believe an agent has authority, even if no express agreement exists.\\n4. **Agency by Ratification:** When a principal accepts and recognizes an agent\\'s unauthorized actions as binding.\\n\\nProper documentation and clear communication are crucial to avoid disputes regarding agency formation.\\n\\n## Agency Dissolution\\n\\nAn agency may be dissolved in two ways:\\n\\n1. By the act of the principal or the agent.\\n2. By operation of law.\\n\\nThe agency may be dissolved by the act of one of the parties. First, as a general rule, it may be laid down that the principal has a right to revoke the powers which he has given; but this is subject to some exception, of which the following are examples. When the principal has expressly stipulated that the authority shall be irrevocable, and the agent has an interest in its execution; it is to be observed, however, that although there may be an express agreement not to revoke, yet if the agent has no interest in its execution, and there is no consideration for the agreement, it will be considered a nude pact, and the authority may be revoked.\\n\\nBut when an authority or power is coupled with an interest, or when it is given for a valuable consideration, or when it is a part of a security, then, unless there is an express stipulation that it shall be revocable, it cannot be revoked, whether it be expressed on the face of the instrument giving the authority, that it be so, or not. The agency may be determined by the renunciation of the agent. If the renunciation be made after it has been partly executed, the agent by renouncing it, becomes liable for the damages which may thereby be sustained by his principal.\\n\\nThe agency is revoked by operation of law in the following cases:\\n\\nFirst, when the agency terminates by the expiration of the period, during which it was to exist, and to have effect; as, if an agency be created to endure a year, or till the happening of a contingency, it becomes extinct at the end or on the happening of the contingency.\\n\\nWhen a change of condition, or of state, produces an incapacity in either party; as, if the principal, being a woman, marry, this would be a revocation, because the power of creating an agent is founded on the right of the principal to do the business himself, and a married woman has no such power.\\n\\nFor the same reason, when the principal becomes insane, the agency is ipso facto revoked. The incapacity of the agent also amounts to a revocation in law, as in case of insanity, and the like, which renders an agent altogether incompetent, but the rule does not reciprocally apply in its full extent. For instance, an infant or a married woman may in some cases be agents, although they cannot act for themselves.\\n\\nThe death of either principal or agent revokes the agency, unless in cases where the agent has an interest in the thing actually vested in the agent.\\n\\nThe agency is revoked in law, by the extinction of the subject-matter of the agency, or of the principal\\'s power over it, or by the complete execution of the trust.\\n\\nAn attorney who transacts the business of another attorney. The agent owes to his principal the unremitted exertions of his skill and ability, and that all his transactions in that character, shall be distinguished by punctuality, honor and integrity.\\n\\n**International Law**\\n\\nOne who is employed by a prince to manage his private affairs, or those of his subjects in his name, near a foreign government.\\n\\n**Contracts**\\n\\nOne who undertakes to manage some affair to be transacted for another, by his authority on account of the latter, who is called the principal, and to render an account of it.\\n\\n## Consequences of Agency Termination\\n\\nThe termination of an agency relationship has significant legal and financial consequences:\\n\\n* **Principal\\'s Responsibilities:** A principal may still be liable for contracts an agent entered into before termination.\\n* **Agent\\'s Obligations:** Agents must return any property, funds, or confidential information belonging to the principal.\\n* **Third-Party Impact:** If third parties were engaged in transactions through the agent, they must be notified of the termination to avoid confusion or unauthorized agreements.\\n\\nIn some cases, termination may lead to legal disputes if either party believes their rights were violated.\\n\\n## Authority of Agents\\n\\n**There are various descriptions of agents, to whom different appellations are given according to the nature of their employments; as brokers, factors, supercargoes, attorneys, and the like; they are all included in this general term.** The authority is created either by deed, by simple writing, by parol, or by mere employment, according to the capacity of the parties, or the nature of the act to be done. It is, therefore, express or implied. Vide Authority.\\n\\nIt is said to be general or special with reference to its object, i.e., according as it is confined to a single act or is extended to all acts connected with a particular employment.\\n\\nWith reference to the manner of its execution, it is either limited or unlimited, i. e. the agent is bound by precise instructions, or left to pursue his own discretion. It is the duty of an agent:\\n\\n1. To perform what he has undertaken in relation to his agency.\\n2. To use all necessary care.\\n3. To render an account.\\n\\nAgents are either joint or several. It is a general rule of the common law, that when an authority is given to two or more persons to do an act, and there is no several authority given, all the agents must concur in doing it, in order to bind the principal.\\n\\nThis rule has been so construed that when the authority is given jointly and severally to three person, two cannot properly execute it; it must be done by all or by one only. Co. Litt. 181 b; Com. Dig. Attorney, C 11; but if the authority is so worded that it is apparent, the principal intended to give power to either of them, an execution by two will be valid.. This rule applies to private agencies: for, in public agencies an authority executed by a major would be sufficient.\\n\\nThe rule in commercial transactions however, is very different; and generally when there are several agents each possesses the whole power. For example, on a consignment of goods for sale to two factors, (whether they are partners or not,) each of them is understood to possess the whole power over the goods for the purposes of the consignment.\\n\\n## Limitations and Risks of Agent Authority\\n\\nWhile agents act on behalf of principals, their authority is not unlimited. Key limitations include:\\n\\n* **Scope of Authorization:** If an agent exceeds their given authority, the principal may not be legally bound to the actions.\\n* **Fiduciary Duty Violations:** If an agent acts in their self-interest rather than the principal\\'s, legal consequences may arise.\\n* **Unauthorized Transactions:** Third parties dealing with an agent must verify their authority to prevent fraud or misrepresentation.\\n\\nUnderstanding these risks helps principals and third parties navigate agency relationships effectively.\\n\\n## Who Can Become an Agent?\\n\\n**As to the persons who are capable of becoming agents, it may be observed, that but few persons are excluded from acting as agents, or from exercising authority delegated to them by others.** It is not, therefore, requisite that a person be sui juris, or capable of acting in his own right, in order to be qualified to act for others. Infants, femes covert, persons attainted or outlawed, aliens and other persons incompetent for many purposes, may act as agents for others.\\n\\nBut in the case of a married woman, it is to be observed, that she cannot be an agent for another when her husband expressly dissents, particularly when he may be rendered liable for her acts. Persons who have clearly no understanding, as idiots and lunatics cannot be agents for others.\\n\\nThere is another class who, though possessing understanding, are incapable of acting as agents for others; these are persons whose duties and characters are incompatible with their obligations to the principal. For example, a person cannot act as agent in buying for another, goods belonging to himself.\\n\\n## Industry-Specific Agency Relationships\\n\\nAgency relationships vary across industries. Some of the most common applications include:\\n\\n* **Real Estate:** Agents act on behalf of buyers or sellers in property transactions.\\n* **Finance and Investment:** Brokers and financial advisors manage assets for clients.\\n* **Employment and Staffing:** Employment agencies place workers with companies, often as intermediaries.\\n* **Insurance:** Agents represent insurance companies or clients in policy agreements.\\n\\nEach industry has specific regulations governing the role and responsibilities of agents.\\n\\n## Agent Rights\\n\\nAn agent has rights which he can enforce, and is, liable to obligations which he must perform. These will be briefly considered: The rights to which agents are entitled, arise from obligations due to them by their principals, or by third persons.\\n\\nTheir rights against their principals are:\\n\\n* To receive a just compensation for their services, when faithfully performed, in execution of a lawful agency, unless such services are entirely gratuitous, or the agreement between the parties repels such a claim; this compensation, usually called a commission, is regulated either by particular agreement or by the usage of trade or the presumed intention of the parties;\\n* To be reimbursed all their just advances, expenses and disbursements made in the course of their agency, on account of, or for the benefit of their principal and also to be paid interest upon such advances, whenever from the nature of the business, or the usage of trade, or the particular agreement of the parties, it may be fairly presumed to have been stipulated for, or due to the agent.\\n\\nBesides the personal remedies which an agent has to enforce his claims against his principal for his commissions and, advancements, he has a lien upon the property of the principal in his hand.\\n\\nThe rights of agents against third persons arise, either on contracts made between such third persons and them, or in consequence of torts committed by the latter.\\n\\nThe rights of agents against third persons on contracts, are:\\n\\n* When the contract is in writing and made expressly with the agent, and imports to be a contract personally with him, although he may be known to act as an agent; as, for example, when a promissory note is given to the agent as such, for the benefit of his principal, and the promise is to pay the money to the agent.\\n* When the agent is the only known or ostensible principal, and therefore, is in contemplation of law, the real contracting party. As, if an agent sell goods of his principal in his own name, as if he were the owner, he is entitled to sue the buyer in his own name; although his principal may also sue. And on the other hand, if he so buy, he may enforce the contract by action.\\n* When, by the usage of trade, the agent is authorized to act as owner, or as a principal contracting party, although his character as agent is known, he may enforce his contract by action.\\n\\nFor example, an auctioneer, who sells the goods of another may maintain an action for the price, because he has a possession coupled with an interest in the goods, and it is a general rule, that whenever an agent, though known as such, has a special property in the subject-matter of the contract, and not a bare-custody, or when he has acquired an interest, or has a lien upon it, he may sue upon the contract. But this right to bring an action by agents is subordinate to the rights of the principal, who may, unless in particular cases, where the agent has a lien, or some other vested right, bring a suit himself, and suspend or extinguish the right of the agent.\\n\\nAgents are entitled to actions against third persons for torts committed against them in the course of their agency. First, they may maintain actions, of trespass or trover against third persons for any torts or injuries affecting their possession of the goods which they hold as agents. When an agent has been induced by the fraud of a third person to sell or buy goods for his principal, and he has sustained loss, he may maintain an action against such third person for such wrongful act, deceit, or fraud.\\n\\nAgents are liable for their acts:\\n\\n* To their principals.\\n* To third persons.\\n\\n## Agent Liability\\n\\nThe liabilities of agents to their principals arise from a violation of their duties and obligations to the principal, by exceeding their authority, by misconduct, or by any negligence or omission, or act by which the principal sustains a loss. Agents may become liable for damages and loss under a special contract, contrary to the general usages of trade. They may also become responsible when charging a del credere commission.\\n\\nAgents become liable to third persons; first, on their contract:\\n\\n* When the agent, undertakes to do an act for another, and does not possess a sufficient authority from the principal, and that is unknown to the other party, he will be considered as having acted for himself as a principal.\\n* When the agent does not disclose his agency, he will be considered as a principal and, in the case of agents or factors, acting for merchants in a foreign country, they will be considered liable whether they disclose their principal or not, this being the usage of the trade; but this presumption may be rebutted by proof of a contrary agreement.\\n* The agent will be liable when he expressly, or by implication, incurs a personal responsibility.\\n* When the agent makes a contract as such, and there is no other responsible as principal, to whom resort can be had; as, if a man sign a note as \"guardian of AB,\" an infant; in that case neither the infant nor his property will be liable, and the agent alone will be responsible.\\n\\nAgents become liable to third persons in regard to torts or wrongs done by them in the course of their agency.\\n\\nA distinction has been made, in relation to third persons, between acts of misfeasance and non-feasance: an agent is, liable for the former, under certain circumstances, but not for the latter; he being responsible for his non-feasance only to his principal.\\n\\nAn agent is liable for misfeasance as to third persons, when, intentionally or ignorantly, he commits a wrong, although authorized by his principal, because no one can lawfully authorize another to commit a wrong upon the rights or property of another.\\n\\nAn agent is liable to refund money, when payment to him is void ab initio, so that, the money was never received for the use of his principal, and he is consequently not accountable to the latter for it, if he has not actually paid it over at the time he receives notice of the take. But unless \"caught with the money in his possession,\" the agent is not responsible.\\n\\nThis last rule is, however, subject to this qualification, that the money shall have been lawfully received by the agent; for if, in receiving it, the agent was a wrongdoer, he will not be exempted from liability by payment to his principal.\\n\\n## Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n1. **What is the difference between an agent and an agency?**\\n   An agent is an individual authorized to act on behalf of another, while an agency refers to the legal relationship between the agent and principal.\\n2. **Can an agent be personally liable for their actions?**\\n   Yes, an agent can be personally liable if they exceed their authority, act fraudulently, or fail to disclose their principal when required.\\n3. **How does an agency relationship end?**\\n   An agency relationship can end through mutual agreement, fulfillment of its purpose, revocation by the principal, or by law (such as death or bankruptcy).\\n4. **What is the role of a real estate agent in an agency relationship?**\\n   A real estate agent acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, negotiating contracts and ensuring compliance with property laws.\\n5. **How can businesses ensure proper agency agreements?**\\n   Businesses should draft clear contracts, define agent authority limits, and document agreements in writing to prevent misunderstandings.\\n\\nIf you need help with understanding agent agency, you can [post your legal need](https://www.upcounsel.com/jobs/new?page_location=article-paj-hyperlink-content) on UpCounsel’s marketplace.

This allows for building common, agent agnostic, higher level functionality such as multi-agent orchestrations.\\n\\nImportant\\n\\nIf you use the Microsoft Agent Framework to build applications that operate with third-party servers or agents, you do so at your own risk. We recommend reviewing all data being shared with third-party servers or agents and being cognizant of third-party practices for retention and location of data. It is your responsibility to manage whether your data will flow outside of your organization’s Azure compliance and geographic boundaries and any related implications.\\n\\n## Simple agents based on inference services\\n\\nThe agent framework makes it easy to create simple agents based on many different inference services.\\nAny inference service that provides an [`Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IChatClient`](/en-us/dotnet/ai/microsoft-extensions-ai#the-ichatclient-interface) implementation can be used to build these agents. The `Microsoft.Agents.AI.ChatClientAgent` is the agent class used to provide an agent for any `IChatClient` implementation.\\n\\nThese agents support a wide range of functionality out of the box:\\n\\n1. Function calling\\n2. Multi-turn conversations with local chat history management or service provided chat history management\\n3. Custom service provided tools (e.g. MCP, Code Execution)\\n4. Structured output\\n\\nTo create one of these agents, simply construct a `ChatClientAgent` using the `IChatClient` implementation of your choice.\\n\\n```\\nusing Microsoft.Agents.AI;\\n\\nvar agent = new ChatClientAgent(chatClient, instructions: \"You are a helpful assistant\");\\n```\\n\\nFor many popular services, we also have helpers to make creating these agents even easier.\\nSee the documentation for each service, for more information:\\n\\n| Underlying Inference Service | Description | Service Chat History storage supported | Custom Chat History storage supported |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| [Azure AI Foundry Agent](azure-ai-foundry-agent) | An agent that uses the Azure AI Foundry Agents Service as its backend. | Yes | No |\\n| [Azure AI Foundry Models ChatCompletion](azure-ai-foundry-models-chat-completion-agent) | An agent that uses any of the models deployed in the Azure AI Foundry Service as its backend via ChatCompletion. | No | Yes |\\n| [Azure AI Foundry Models Responses](azure-ai-foundry-models-responses-agent) | An agent that uses any of the models deployed in the Azure AI Foundry Service as its backend via Responses. | No | Yes |\\n| [Azure OpenAI ChatCompletion](azure-openai-chat-completion-agent) | An agent that uses the Azure OpenAI ChatCompletion service. | No | Yes |\\n| [Azure OpenAI Responses](azure-openai-responses-agent) | An agent that uses the Azure OpenAI Responses service. | Yes | Yes |\\n| [OpenAI ChatCompletion](openai-chat-completion-agent) | An agent that uses the OpenAI ChatCompletion service. | No | Yes |\\n| [OpenAI Responses](openai-responses-agent) | An agent that uses the OpenAI Responses service. | Yes | Yes |\\n| [OpenAI Assistants](openai-assistants-agent) | An agent that uses the OpenAI Assistants service. | Yes | No |\\n| [Any other `IChatClient`](chat-client-agent) | You can also use any other [`Microsoft.Extensions.AI.IChatClient`](/en-us/dotnet/ai/microsoft-extensions-ai#the-ichatclient-interface) implementation to create an agent. | Varies | Varies |\\n\\n## Complex custom agents\\n\\nIt is also possible to create fully custom agents, that are not just wrappers around an `IChatClient`.\\nThe agent framework provides the `AIAgent` base type.\\nThis base type is the core abstraction for all agents, which when subclassed allows for complete control over the agent\\'s behavior and capabilities.\\n\\nSee the documentation for [Custom Agents](custom-agent) for more information.\\n\\n## Proxies for remote agents\\n\\nThe agent framework provides out of the box `AIAgent` implementations for common service hosted agent protocols,\\nsuch as A2A. This way you can easily connect to and use remote agents from your application.\\n\\nSee the documentation for each agent type, for more information:\\n\\n| Protocol | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| [A2A](a2a-agent) | An agent that serves as a proxy to a remote agent via the A2A protocol. |\\n\\n## Azure and OpenAI SDK Options Reference\\n\\nWhen using Azure AI Foundry, Azure OpenAI, or OpenAI services, you have various SDK options to connect to these services. In some cases, it is possible to use multiple SDKs to connect to the same service or to use the same SDK to connect to different services. Here is a list of the different options available with the url that you should use when connecting to each. Make sure to replace `<resource>` and `<project>` with your actual resource and project names.\\n\\n| AI Service | SDK | Nuget | Url |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| [Azure AI Foundry Models](/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/foundry-models-overview) | Azure OpenAI SDK 2 | [Azure.AI.OpenAI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.OpenAI) | https://ai-foundry-<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/ |\\n| [Azure AI Foundry Models](/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/foundry-models-overview) | OpenAI SDK 3 | [OpenAI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenAI) | https://ai-foundry-<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/openai/v1/ |\\n| [Azure AI Foundry Models](/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/foundry-models-overview) | Azure AI Inference SDK 2 | [Azure.AI.Inference](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.Inference) | https://ai-foundry-<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/models |\\n| [Azure AI Foundry Agents](/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/overview) | Azure AI Persistent Agents SDK | [Azure.AI.Agents.Persistent](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.Agents.Persistent) | https://ai-foundry-<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/ai-project-<project> |\\n| [Azure OpenAI](/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/overview) 1 | Azure OpenAI SDK 2 | [Azure.AI.OpenAI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.OpenAI) | https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/ |\\n| [Azure OpenAI](/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/overview) 1 | OpenAI SDK | [OpenAI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenAI) | https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/ |\\n| OpenAI | OpenAI SDK | [OpenAI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenAI) | No url required |\\n\\n1. [Upgrading from Azure OpenAI to Azure AI Foundry](/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/upgrade-azure-openai)\\n2. We recommend using the OpenAI SDK.\\n3. While we recommend using the OpenAI SDK to access Azure AI Foundry models, Azure AI Foundry Models support models from many different vendors, not just OpenAI. All these models are supported via the OpenAI SDK.\\n\\n### Using the OpenAI SDK\\n\\nAs shown in the table above, the OpenAI SDK can be used to connect to multiple services.\\nDepending on the service you are connecting to, you may need to set a custom URL when creating the `OpenAIClient`.\\nYou can also use different authentication mechanisms depending on the service.\\n\\nIf a custom URL is required (see table above), you can set it via the OpenAIClientOptions.\\n\\n```\\nvar clientOptions = new OpenAIClientOptions() { Endpoint = new Uri(serviceUrl) };\\n```\\n\\nIt\\'s possible to use an API key when creating the client.\\n\\n```\\nOpenAIClient client = new OpenAIClient(new ApiKeyCredential(apiKey), clientOptions);\\n```\\n\\nWhen using an Azure Service, it\\'s also possible to use Azure credentials instead of an API key.\\n\\n```\\nOpenAIClient client = new OpenAIClient(new BearerTokenPolicy(new AzureCliCredential(), \"https://ai.azure.com/.default\"), clientOptions)\\n```\\n\\nOnce you have created the OpenAIClient, you can get a sub client for the specific service you want to use and then create an `AIAgent` from that.\\n\\n```\\nAIAgent agent = client\\n    .GetChatClient(model)\\n    .CreateAIAgent(instructions: \"You are good at telling jokes.\", name: \"Joker\");\\n```\\n\\n### Using the Azure OpenAI SDK\\n\\nThis SDK can be used to connect to both Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Foundry Models services.\\nEither way, you will need to supply the correct service URL when creating the `AzureOpenAIClient`.\\nSee the table above for the correct URL to use.\\n\\n```\\nAIAgent agent = new AzureOpenAIClient(\\n    new Uri(serviceUrl),\\n    new AzureCliCredential())\\n     .GetChatClient(deploymentName)\\n     .CreateAIAgent(instructions: \"You are good at telling jokes.\", name: \"Joker\");\\n```\\n\\n### Using the Azure AI Persistent Agents SDK\\n\\nThis SDK is only supported with the Azure AI Foundry Agents service. See the table above for the correct URL to use.\\n\\n```\\nvar persistentAgentsClient = new PersistentAgentsClient(serviceUrl, new AzureCliCredential());\\nAIAgent agent = await persistentAgentsClient.CreateAIAgentAsync(\\n    model: deploymentName,\\n    name: \"Joker\",\\n    instructions: \"You are good at telling jokes.\");\\n```\\n\\n## Simple agents based on inference services\\n\\nThe agent framework makes it easy to create simple agents based on many different inference services.\\nAny inference service that provides a chat client implementation can be used to build these agents.\\n\\nThese agents support a wide range of functionality out of the box:\\n\\n1. Function calling\\n2. Multi-turn conversations with local chat history management or service provided chat history management\\n3. Custom service provided tools (e.g. MCP, Code Execution)\\n4. Structured output\\n5. Streaming responses\\n\\nTo create one of these agents, simply construct a `ChatAgent` using the chat client implementation of your choice.\\n\\n```\\nfrom agent_framework import ChatAgent\\nfrom agent_framework.azure import AzureAIAgentClient\\nfrom azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential\\n\\nasync with (\\n    DefaultAzureCredential() as credential,\\n    ChatAgent(\\n        chat_client=AzureAIAgentClient(async_credential=credential),\\n        instructions=\"You are a helpful assistant\"\\n    ) as agent\\n):\\n    response = await agent.run(\"Hello!\")\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, you can use the convenience method on the chat client:\\n\\n```\\nfrom agent_framework.azure import AzureAIAgentClient\\nfrom azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential\\n\\nasync with DefaultAzureCredential() as credential:\\n    agent = AzureAIAgentClient(async_credential=credential).create_agent(\\n        instructions=\"You are a helpful assistant\"\\n    )\\n```\\n\\nFor detailed examples, see the agent-specific documentation sections below.\\n\\n### Supported Agent Types\\n\\n| Underlying Inference Service | Description | Service Chat History storage supported | Custom Chat History storage supported |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| [Azure AI Agent](azure-ai-foundry-agent) | An agent that uses the Azure AI Agents Service as its backend. | Yes | No |\\n| [Azure OpenAI Chat Completion](azure-openai-chat-completion-agent) | An agent that uses the Azure OpenAI Chat Completion service. | No | Yes |\\n| [Azure OpenAI Responses](azure-openai-responses-agent) | An agent that uses the Azure OpenAI Responses service. | Yes | Yes |\\n| [OpenAI Chat Completion](openai-chat-completion-agent) | An agent that uses the OpenAI Chat Completion service. | No | Yes |\\n| [OpenAI Responses](openai-responses-agent) | An agent that uses the OpenAI Responses service. | Yes | Yes |\\n| [OpenAI Assistants](openai-assistants-agent) | An agent that uses the OpenAI Assistants service. | Yes | No |\\n| [Any other ChatClient](chat-client-agent) | You can also use any other chat client implementation to create an agent. | Varies | Varies |\\n\\n### Function Tools\\n\\nYou can provide function tools to agents for enhanced capabilities:\\n\\n```\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\nfrom pydantic import Field\\nfrom azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential\\nfrom agent_framework.azure import AzureAIAgentClient\\n\\ndef get_weather(location: Annotated[str, Field(description=\"The location to get the weather for.\")]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Get the weather for a given location.\"\"\"\\n    return f\"The weather in {location} is sunny with a high of 25°C.\"\\n\\nasync with (\\n    DefaultAzureCredential() as credential,\\n    AzureAIAgentClient(async_credential=credential).create_agent(\\n        instructions=\"You are a helpful weather assistant.\",\\n        tools=get_weather\\n    ) as agent\\n):\\n    response = await agent.run(\"What\\'s the weather in Seattle?\")\\n```\\n\\nFor complete examples with function tools, see:\\n\\n* [Azure AI with function tools](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/samples/getting_started/agents/azure_ai/azure_ai_with_function_tools.py)\\n* [Azure OpenAI with function

tools](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/samples/getting_started/agents/openai/openai_with_function_tools.py)\\n\\n### Streaming Responses\\n\\nAgents support both regular and streaming responses:\\n\\n```\\n# Regular response (wait for complete result)\\nresponse = await agent.run(\"What\\'s the weather like in Seattle?\")\\nprint(response.text)\\n\\n# Streaming response (get results as they are generated)\\nasync for chunk in agent.run_stream(\"What\\'s the weather like in Portland?\"):\\n    if chunk.text:\\n        print(chunk.text, end=\"\", flush=True)\\n```\\n\\nFor streaming examples, see:\\n\\n* [Azure AI streaming examples](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/samples/getting_started/agents/azure_ai/azure_ai_basic.py)\\n* [Azure OpenAI streaming

examples](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/samples/getting_started/agents/openai/openai_basic.py)\\n\\n### Code Interpreter Tools\\n\\nAzure AI agents support hosted code interpreter tools for executing Python code:\\n\\n```\\nfrom agent_framework import ChatAgent, HostedCodeInterpreterTool\\nfrom agent_framework.azure import AzureAIAgentClient\\nfrom azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential\\n\\nasync with (\\n    DefaultAzureCredential() as credential,\\n    ChatAgent(\\n        chat_client=AzureAIAgentClient(async_credential=credential),\\n        instructions=\"You are a helpful assistant that can execute Python code.\",\\n        tools=HostedCodeInterpreterTool()\\n    ) as agent\\n):\\n    response = await agent.run(\"Calculate the factorial of 100 using Python\")\\n```\\n\\nFor code interpreter examples, see:\\n\\n* [Azure AI with code interpreter](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/samples/getting_started/agents/azure_ai/azure_ai_with_code_interpreter.py)\\n* [Azure OpenAI Assistants with code

code interpreter](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/samples/getting_started/agents/openai_assistants_client/openai_assistants_with_code_interpreter.py)\\n\\n## Custom agents\\n\\nIt is also possible to create fully custom agents that are not just wrappers around a chat client.\\nAgent Framework provides the `AgentProtocol` protocol and `BaseAgent` base class, which when implemented/subclassed allows for complete control over the agent\\'s behavior and capabilities.\\n\\n```\\nfrom agent_framework import BaseAgent, AgentRunResponse, AgentRunResponseUpdate, AgentThread, ChatMessage\\nfrom collections.abc import AsyncIterable\\n\\nclass CustomAgent(BaseAgent):\\n    async def run(\\n        self,\\n        messages: str | ChatMessage | list[str] | list[ChatMessage] | None = None,\\n        *,\\n        thread: AgentThread | None = None,\\n        **kwargs: Any,\\n    ) -> AgentRunResponse:\\n        # Custom agent implementation\\n        pass\\n\\n    def run_stream(\\n        self,\\n        messages: str | ChatMessage | list[str] | list[ChatMessage] | None = None,\\n        *,\\n        thread: AgentThread | None = None,\\n

Thinking...\\n\\nYour [project management](https://kroolo.com/solutions/project-management) system doesn't just track tasks—it anticipates bottlenecks, automatically reassigns resources, and proactively communicates with stakeholders before issues arise.\\n\\nWelcome to the era of agentic AI trends that are transforming how businesses operate. Unlike traditional AI that waits for commands, agentic AI systems think, plan, and act autonomously to achieve specific goals.\\n\\nAs we navigate through 2025, these intelligent agents are moving from experimental concepts to mission-critical business tools, promising to revolutionize everything from strategic planning to daily operations.\\n\\n## Current State of Agentic AI\\n\\nAgentic AI represents a fundamental shift from reactive to proactive artificial intelligence systems. These advanced AI systems can act independently, make decisions, and adapt to changing situations with minimal human oversight. The technology has evolved beyond simple automation to encompass strategic planning, multi-step automation, and dynamic problem-solving.\\n\\n### Defining Agentic AI in Today's Context\\n\\nAgentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed with agency, meaning they can act autonomously to achieve specific [goals](https://kroolo.com/features/goals). Unlike conventional AI tools that simply respond to prompts or carry out single predefined commands, agentic AI systems demonstrate remarkable capabilities by understanding goals, making decisions about achievement pathways, executing multiple sequential steps, and learning from outcomes.\\n\\nMicrosoft describes agentic AI as an autonomous AI system that plans, reasons and acts to complete tasks with minimal human oversight. This definition highlights three critical components that distinguish agentic AI from traditional automation:\\n\\n* Planning capability: The ability to break down complex objectives into actionable steps\\n* Reasoning functionality: Making informed decisions based on context and available data\\n* Autonomous action: Executing [tasks](https://kroolo.com/features/tasks) without constant human intervention.\\n\\n[![Sign Up for Kroolo ](https://d1x9j2lb4srxrw.cloudfront.net/media/uploads/2025/09/24/sign-up_vTbLQtM.png)](https://app.kroolo.com/signup?utm_source=Blog&utm_medium=CTA&utm_campaign=Sign-up)\\n\\n## Key Characteristics Driving Adoption\\n\\nModern agentic AI systems exhibit five fundamental characteristics that make them invaluable for enterprise applications:\\n\\n### Goal-Oriented Focus:\\n\\nThese systems concentrate on achieving specific objectives and continuously adjust strategies to optimize results. For instance, an AI agent managing customer satisfaction can analyze feedback patterns and identify recurring complaints to provide targeted solutions.\\n\\n### Adaptive Learning:\\n\\nAgentic AI learns from interactions and feedback to improve performance over time. A virtual assistant refines its recommendations based on user preferences, learning which responses generate better engagement and outcomes.\\n\\n### Operational Autonomy:\\n\\nThese systems operate independently, making decisions and taking actions without human intervention. An [agentic AI](https://kroolo.com/blog/ai-agentic-workflow) managing system maintenance can detect performance issues and schedule fixes proactively.\\n\\n### Environmental Awareness:\\n\\nThe ability to observe changes in surroundings and modify actions accordingly ensures relevance and effectiveness. A scheduling AI detects last-minute availability changes and automatically reschedules meetings to minimize disruptions.\\n\\n### Multi-Agent Collaboration:\\n\\nWorking alongside other [AI agents](https://kroolo.com/ai/ai-agent) and systems enables handling of complex workflows that require diverse expertise areas.\\n\\n### Market Growth and Enterprise Adoption\\n\\nThe agentic AI market demonstrates explosive growth potential. In 2024, investors valued the market at $5.1 billion, with projections indicating it will exceed $47 billion within the next few years, growing at a remarkable 44 percent annual rate. This growth reflects increasing business reliance on AI agents for automation and strategic decision-making.\\n\\nGartner's research provides compelling evidence of this trend, predicting that by 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will embed agentic AI capabilities, compared to almost none in 2023. Furthermore, Gartner forecasts that 15 percent of daily work decisions will be made autonomously by agentic AI by 2028, up from virtually zero today.\\n\\nThis transformation is particularly evident in how businesses are moving beyond content generation tools toward systems that can plan, decide, and act autonomously. Enterprise software vendors are prioritizing agentic capabilities, investing heavily in features that include AI systems handling multi-step workflows, updating records, sending notifications, and making decisions without requiring manual approval.\\n\\n## Agentic AI Trends in 2025\\n\\nAs we progress through 2025, several transformative agentic AI trends are reshaping business landscapes across industries. These trends represent not just technological advancement but fundamental changes in how organizations approach productivity, decision-making, and strategic planning.\\n\\n### 1. Autonomous Task Management\\n\\nThe most significant agentic AI trend in 2025 is the complete transformation of workplace dynamics. Agentic AI systems are handling increasingly complex repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus on strategy, problem-solving, and creative work. This shift requires businesses to fundamentally rethink how humans and AI collaborate.\\n\\nOrganizations are discovering that agentic AI excels at managing routine project management tasks that previously consumed significant human resources. For example, these systems can automatically assign tasks based on team member availability and expertise, track project progress across multiple departments, and identify potential roadblocks before they impact timelines.\\n\\nKroolo exemplifies this trend through its comprehensive approach to AI-powered project management. The platform's ability to create [AI agents](https://kroolo.com/blog/what-are-ai-agents) from scratch enables organizations to develop custom autonomous systems tailored to their specific workflow requirements. These agents can manage complex project lifecycles, coordinate cross-functional teams, and maintain consistent communication with stakeholders without constant human oversight.\\n\\n### 2. Collaborative Team Members\\n\\nMoving beyond traditional tool-based interactions, AI agents are evolving into [collaborative team](https://kroolo.com/blog/team-collaboration-examples) members rather than passive instruments. These systems participate in strategic discussions, analyze ongoing data to suggest optimizations, and proactively identify opportunities for improvement.\\n\\nThis trend manifests in several ways:\\n\\nStrategic Participation:\\nAI agents contribute to planning meetings by analyzing historical data and suggesting resource allocation strategies.\\n\\nProactive Problem-Solving:\\nSystems identify potential issues before they become critical problems and propose solutions.\\n\\nContinuous Optimization:\\nAgents monitor team performance metrics and suggest [workflow](https://kroolo.com/blog/workflow-automation) improvements in real-time.\\n\\nKroolo's platform demonstrates this collaborative approach through its extensive tools for AI agents, which enable seamless integration between artificial and human intelligence. Teams can leverage these tools to create agents that not only execute tasks but actively contribute to strategic decision-making processes.\\n\\n### 3.

Falling behind is riskier than ever as the next wave of agentic AI raises the stakes.\\n\\nBy David Crawford, Anne Hoecker, Chuck Whitten, Jue Wang, Aaron Lewis, and Ryan Petranovich\\n\\n* Published on September 23, 2025\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nReport\\n\\n###### State of the Art of Agentic AI Transformation\\n\\nen\\n\\n##### At a Glance\\n\\n* AI leaders have moved from pilots to profits, delivering 10% to 25% EBITDA gains by scaling AI across core workflows.\\n* Falling behind is increasingly risky: Companies still experimenting should follow the proven playbook for AI transformation.\\n* Agentic AI offers another round of gains but requires more technology for agents to interact and operate across silos.\\n* The pace of innovation demands pragmatism, not purity; winners will build momentum with fit-for-purpose solutions.\\n\\nThis article is part of Bain’s Technology Report 2025\\n\\n[Explore the report](/insights/topics/technology-report/)\\n\\nArtificial intelligence continues to surge ahead at an unprecedented pace—catapulting some companies forward and leaving others far behind.\\n\\nIn 2023 and 2024, tech-forward enterprises broke through the pilot phase, achieving 10% to 25% EBITDA gains by scaling information retrieval and single-task AI. In doing so, they established a repeatable playbook that others can now follow—grounded in robust methodology, analytic tools, and clear benchmarks.\\n\\nYet a year on, most organizations remain stuck in experimentation mode, satisfied with minor productivity gains that haven’t delivered significant value. But as the leaders move forward, falling behind risks ceding competitive ground that may be difficult to recover.\\n\\nAnd things are about to get even more interesting: In the first half of 2025, major players—including Anthropic, Alphabet, Microsoft, OpenAI, Salesforce, and others—debuted their visions of agentic AI. Tech-forward enterprises are already turning their focus from automating tasks to redesigning entire workflows. Early adopters are figuring out how agents will coexist safely, discover each other, gather the context and data they need, and collaborate productively. As the vision meets reality, they’ll also wrestle with data silos, informal context, intellectual property, privacy, security, and vendor profit motives.\\n\\nA purist view of architecture won’t meet the moment. Given the current pace of AI innovation, the most likely scenario is that we’ll see rapid, fitful, and hard-to-predict progress. Companies should maintain an architectural North Star but sustain progress with fit-for-purpose, domain-specific, and human-in-the-loop builds for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nMaximizing value demands focused attention on a few key priorities:\\n\\n* **Keep up the pace.** The most important tasks remain redesigning processes and workflows while cleaning up data. Falling further behind is dangerous.\\n* **Follow the taillights of the enterprise leaders.** The playbook is established, with methodology, analytic tools, and benchmarks available.\\n* **Take a principled but flexible view of architecture.** Balance long-term vision with flexible, domain-specific solutions to keep pace with AI’s progress.\\n\\n### Leaders cracked the code\\n\\nIn our *2023 Tech Report*, we wrote about how some leaders were beginning to unlock the secrets of AI productivity (see “[You’re Out of Time to Wait and See on AI](/insights/youre-out-of-time-to-wait-and-see-on-ai-tech-report-2023/)”). In 2024, we could already see clear patterns about where AI ROI could reliably be captured (see “[Five Functions Where AI Is Already Delivering](/insights/five-functions-where-ai-is-already-delivering-tech-report-2024/)”). While transformation styles varied, these early adopters have delivered a roadmap with proven methodology, analytic tools, and benchmarks. We can summarize this roadmap with five critical actions:\\n\\n* Set ambitious goals based on top-down diagnostics, not trials and pilots.\\n* Charge general managers with meeting these targets, not the CIO or CTO.\\n* Redesign entire workflows, not siloed activities or use cases.\\n* Curate and clean the data and application environment as needed, not holistically.\\n* Make, buy, or partner to build capabilities for each major workflow, rather than waiting for enterprise-wide solutions.\\n\\nThe biggest insight from these transformations is that the most important aspects of the transformation are process redesign and cleaning up the data and application environment. Because of this, it doesn’t make sense to wait for the dust to settle on technology. There’s no way to cut corners on process, data, and application cleanup. Every day a company waits is another day it’s left behind.\\n\\n### AI leaders pursue agentic AI\\n\\nAI innovation increasingly focuses on enabling models to work with much more complex reasoning, context, and unstructured data while communicating with SaaS applications and other agents (see Figure 1).\\n\\nFigure 1\\n\\nAI innovation continues at an unprecedented pace\\n\\n![visualization](https://public.flourish.studio/story/3318926/thumbnail)\\n\\nAs noted earlier, many tech giants debuted their visions of agentic AI in the first half of 2025. While flavors vary, the underlying progression of capabilities crystallizes into four levels.\\n\\n* **Level 1:\\xa0 LLM-powered information retrieval agents** (e.g., knowledge assistants, copilots)\\n* **Level 2:\\xa0 Single-task agentic workflows** (e.g., task-doers with self-contained action loops)\\n* **Level 3:\\xa0 Cross-system agentic workflow orchestration** (e.g., complex workflow execution, supervised agents)\\n* **Level 4:\\xa0 Multi-agent constellations** (e.g., any-to-any agent, loosely coupled collaborative agents)\\n\\nTech-forward companies scaled Level 1 tools in 2023 and 2024, with varying degrees of success. When deployed in a diffuse way, they delivered microproductivity—what we might call “grab-a-coffee\" time-savers. But when deeply embedded in functional workflows in areas such as sales, development, and product management, the gains compounded—especially after heavy data cleaning and curation as well as continuous high-quality governance.\\n\\nLevels 2 and 3 are now where capital, innovation, and deployment velocity are converging (see Figure 2). \\xa0Level 4 is on the whiteboard, held back by several practical realities outlined in the next section.\\n\\nFigure 2\\n\\nAI companies are pushing development into Levels 2 and 3\\n\\n![visualization](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/25027274/thumbnail)\\n\\nNotes: ARR stands for annual recurring revenue, a measure of predictable subscription-based revenue; CRM stands for customer relationship management, a software tool for tracking customers and sales\\n\\nSource: Company websites; Mercor CEO interview in Tech Crunch; CB Insights\\n\\n### Practical, not purist architecture\\n\\nIn 2025, leading tech companies turned their attention to making single- and multi-system workflows smarter, powered by agents.\\n\\nAs vendors race to bring their agentic visions to life, enterprise teams face\\xa0new challenges: How will these agents operate safely, find and connect with each other, gather the context and data they need, and collaborate productively as the vision meets the reality of vendor profit motives, data silos, informal context, enterprise data, IP, and security?\\n\\nAs higher levels of agentic autonomy are pursued, enterprises are encountering a number of thorny issues.\\n\\n* **Human work:** Most work happens across multiple systems and organizations, with context and informal processes.\\n* **Technology gaps:** These include a lack of communication standards (Model Context Protocol, or MCP, isn’t USB) and compounding errors in multistep tasks.\\n* **Enterprise reality:** Data isn’t clean, and privacy, security, and intellectual property are real concerns.\\n* **Vendor motives:** These run counter to open standards, shared IP, workflows, and data, leading to battles and walled gardens.\\n\\nSeveral architectural visions exist for how higher levels of agentic autonomy can be enabled. Most call for an interconnected fabric or mesh that will register, distribute, and allow communication between agents to enable secure collaboration. Some visions are more libertarian than others, but most resemble Web 3.0: a logical vision for how things should work if no one were greedy and governance and accountability were not thorny issues. Much like Web 3.0, we expect these visions to serve as a useful aspiration, but we don’t expect them to survive contact with enterprise reality unchanged.\\n\\nFor this reason, a rigid approach to architecture falls short of what’s needed. With AI moving at breakneck speed, progress is likely to be rapid, uneven, and tough to forecast. Walled gardens will take the lead. Fit-for-purpose custom builds will dominate enterprise-wide architectures for some time. Human-in-the-loop applications are likely the pragmatic reality for years. Context and graph analytics will remain closely guarded assets. Standards battles will play out at lightning pace (witness the\\xa0MCP and Agent-to-Agent, or A2A, adoption tipping points); incumbents may try to selectively open source their IP; and domain-specific leaders will emerge.\\n\\n### Now is the moment to act\\n\\nMaximizing value in this next phase demands disciplined focus on a small set of high-impact priorities. The organizations that move decisively will extend their lead; those that hesitate risk being left behind.\\n\\n* **Keep up the pace.** The critical work remains redesigning processes and workflows while cleaning and standardizing data. Any further delay compounds technical debt and makes catching up much harder.\\n* **Follow the taillights of enterprise leaders.** The path forward is well-mapped. Proven playbooks, tested methodologies, advanced analytic tools, and benchmark data are already available. Focus on them to accelerate progress rather than reinventing the wheel.\\n* **Take a principled but flexible view of architecture.** Expect domain-specific platforms, not one-size-fits-all enterprise systems—for example, tailored solutions for supply chain, sales, and other key domains. Plan for human-in-the-loop oversight for now—think Iron Man suits, not fully autonomous Iron Man robots. Finally, select vendors strategically to limit (or at least balance) agent lock-in and preserve optionality for future evolution.\\n\\n[Read the Next Section\\n\\nAI Is Transforming Productivity, but

Agentic AI is different from today’s chatbots and co-pilots, which themselves are often called “agents.” Agentic AI has the potential to make knowledge workers more productive and to automate multi-step processes across business functions. Deloitte predicts that in 2025, 25% of companies that use gen AI will launch agentic AI pilots or proofs of concept, growing to 50% in 2027.[1](#endnote-1) Some agentic AI applications, in some industries, and for some use cases, could see actual adoption into existing workflows in 2025, especially by the back half of the year.\\n\\nTheir efforts are being aided by startups and established tech companies developing agentic AI, both of which see the technology’s potential to spur revenue growth. Investors have poured over $2 billion into agentic AI startups in the past two years, focusing their investment on companies that target the enterprise market.[2](#endnote-2) Meanwhile, many tech companies, cloud providers, and others are developing their own agentic AI offerings. They are also making strategic acquisitions, and increasingly licensing agentic AI technology from startups and hiring their employees, instead of buying the companies outright.[3](#endnote-3)\\n\\n![](/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\\n\\n## Agentic AI puts the “agency” in agent\\n\\nGen AI chatbots and co-pilots are sophisticated; they can interact intuitively with humans, synthesize complex information, and generate content. But they lack the degree of agency and autonomy that agentic AI promises. While chatbots and agents share the same foundation—large language models (LLM)—additional technologies and techniques enable agents to act independently, break a job down into discrete steps, and complete their work with minimal human supervision or intervention. AI agents don’t just interact. They more effectively reason and act on behalf of the user.\\n\\nAs its name suggests, agentic AI has “agency”: the ability to act, and to choose which actions to take.[4](#endnote-4) Agency implies autonomy, which is the power to act and make decisions *independently*.[5](#endnote-5) When we extend these concepts to agentic AI, we can say it can act on its own to plan, execute, and achieve a goal—it becomes “agentic”. [6](#endnote-6) The goals are set by humans, but the agents determine how to fulfill those goals.\\n\\nAn example can illustrate the difference between agentic AI and co-pilots and chatbots. Co-pilots that assist software developers by testing and suggesting code are one of the most successful gen AI use cases to date.[7](#endnote-7) They can make experienced software engineers more productive and increase the effectiveness of junior coders. They can convert natural language prompts (in multiple languages) into suggestions for code, and test code for consistency. But such co-pilots only respond to prompts from engineers and do not show agency. With agentic AI, the software “engineer” takes this a step further. A human coder can enter ideas for software through a prompt, and the agentic AI “software engineer” converts those ideas into executable code, a process that automates multiple steps in the software development process.\\n\\n![](/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\\n\\nFor example, Cognition Software launched “Devin” in March 2024 with the goal of creating an autonomous software engineer capable of reasoning, planning, and completing complex engineering tasks that require thousands of decisions.[8](#endnote-8) Devin was designed to perform programming jobs unassisted, based on natural language prompts from human programmers. These jobs include designing full applications, testing and fixing codebases, and training and tuning LLMs.[9](#endnote-9) Competitors like Codeium, which focuses on enterprise software development, and open-source versions of Devin, hit the market in summer 2024.[10](#endnote-10)\\n\\nAgentic AI software engineers share similar capabilities and vulnerabilities.[11](#endnote-11) One vulnerability is that they currently make too many errors to handle full, or even partial, jobs without human oversight. In a recent benchmarking test, Devin was able to resolve nearly 14% of GitHub issues\\xa0from real-world code repositories—twice as good as LLM-based chatbots,[12](#endnote-12) but not fully autonomous. Big tech companies[13](#endnote-13) and startups are striving to make agentic AI software engineers more autonomous and reliable, so human coders—and their employers—can trust them to handle parts of their workload (figure 1).\\n\\n### Share image\\n\\n* Share\\n  + linkedin\\n  + twitter\\n  + facebook\\n\\n### Or copy link\\n\\nCopy\\n\\n![](/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\\n\\n## Augmenting and amplifying labor productivity\\n\\nAgentic AI software engineers are just one example of how autonomous generative AI agents could transform how work is done (see [Promising use cases for autonomous gen AI agents](#promising-use)\\xa0below). As agentic AI improves, its impact could be enormous. There are over 100 million knowledge workers in the US, and over 1.25 billion knowledge workers globally.[14](#endnote-14) Total factor productivity,[15](#endnote-15) a useful proxy for knowledge work, has stagnated in the United States, growing 0.8% from 1987 to 2023 and only 0.5% from 2019 to 2023.[16](#endnote-16) In most OECD countries, the story is the same.[17](#endnote-17) Attempts to increase the productivity of knowledge work by automating tasks have met with only partial success. Many companies also need more knowledge workers. Shortfalls of customer service representatives, semiconductor engineers, and seemingly everything in between persist. When new workers start, they need to be productive quickly.\\n\\nExpert systems and robotic process automation (RPA) can falter when processes are ambiguous or require multiple steps. Systems based on traditional machine learning require extensive training, which is tailored for specific purposes. Built on LLMs, agentic AI can be more flexible, and it can address a broader range of use cases than machine learning or deep learning.\\n\\nAgentic AI can significantly advance the capabilities of LLMs and could vindicate the investments companies are making in gen AI. The public release of gen AI tools has quickly captured the attention of executives. It was easy to imagine how their organizations could use the technology. Quantifiable business value from gen AI has often been elusive, however. Challenges with data foundations, risk and governance policies, and talent gaps make it hard for companies to scale gen AI initiatives.[18](#endnote-18) Only 30% of gen AI pilots make it to full production.[19](#endnote-19) Lack of trust in gen AI output, and potential “real world” consequences from gen AI mistakes, give executives pause.[20](#endnote-20)\\n\\nCompanies that develop and implement agentic AI need to consider the challenges of gen AI, plus the complexity of building bots that can reason, act, collaborate, and create. Most importantly, gen AI agents of all kinds need to be reliable for enterprises to use them: Getting the job right most of the time isn’t enough. There are some use cases and applications in late 2024 that show encouraging signs of being reliable enough for adoption in early 2025.\\n\\nThe potential payoff is worth the effort, however, and early results seem promising. Companies are learning how to boost LLM performance by combining these models with other AI technologies and training techniques. While autonomous and reliable agents are the goal, incremental increases in accuracy and independence could help companies reach their early productivity and efficiency goals for gen AI overall.[21](#endnote-21) With their range of applications—both horizontal and vertical—and clear business goals, agentic AI looks more like the gen AI solutions executives may have expected in the first place.\\n\\n![](/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\\n\\n## Gen AI agents explained: A closer look\\n\\nGenerative AI agents can break down a complex task into a series of steps, execute them, and work through unexpected barriers. They can sense their environment, which depending on the use case can be virtual, physical, or a combination of the two. To complete a task, agentic AI can determine which actions to take, recruit assistance from tools, databases, and other agents, and deliver results based on its goals set by humans.\\n\\nAgentic AI is an emerging technology—and it continues to evolve—but it has some common characteristics and capabilities:\\n\\n* **Built on foundation models:** Foundation models like LLMs enable agentic AI to reason, analyze, and adapt to complex and unpredictable workflows. This makes it more flexible than RPA and expert systems. LLMs are improving rapidly, with enhanced reasoning and ability to break tasks into smaller steps among the most recent breakthroughs.[22](#endnote-22) But foundation models alone can’t interact with their environment, make decisions, or execute tasks.[23](#endnote-23) They must be augmented by other technologies and capabilities.\\n* **Acts autonomously:** While the degree of autonomy varies, agentic AI can be trained to plan and execute complex tasks largely on its own. By introducing reasoning tokens, chain-of-thought models can solve more complex challenges than previous LLMs. Chain-of-thought models are slower to respond but are more deliberative in how they reason through a problem; they can correct their own errors; and they can show the steps they have taken to reach a solution.[24](#endnote-24)\\n* **Senses the environment:** Agentic AI can perceive the environment, process information, and understand the context of the tasks it is given.[25](#endnote-25) Advanced agentic AI can process multimodal data, such as videos, images, audio, text, and numbers.\\n* **Uses tools:** Agentic AI interacts with tools and systems to complete tasks, such as software, enterprise applications, and the internet.\\n* **Orchestrates:** Agentic AI can direct the participation of other systems and bots to complete a task. With multiagent systems, this means collaborating with other autonomous generative AI agents.\\n* **Accesses memory:** LLMs are stateless: Each interaction is processed independently, and information is not retained when an interaction is complete. With the addition of retrieval mechanisms and databases, agentic AI can access short-term memory to maintain context while performing a specific task, and long-term memory to learn and improve from experience.[26](#endnote-26)\\n\\n![](/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\\n\\nStartups and big tech are developing multiagent gen AI systems, including tools that can help organizations build their own custom agents.\\n\\n![](/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\\n\\nSome of the latest models employ chain-of-thought functions that, while slower and more deliberative than prior large-scale models, enable higher-order reasoning on complex problems.[27](#endnote-27) Multimodal data analysis can make agentic AI more flexible by expanding the kinds of data that can be interpreted and produced. Multimodal AI also shows that agentic AI can be even more powerful when combined with other kinds of AI technologies such as computer vision (image recognition), and transcription and translation.[28](#endnote-28) Like agents themselves, multimodal AI is still developing.\\n\\nTrue multiagent systems, in which work is orchestrated among a network of autonomous agents, are being developed now, with some pilots being launched in late 2024.[29](#endnote-29) Multiagent models often outperform single-model systems by distributing tasks, especially in complex environments.[30](#endnote-30) Startups and big tech are developing multiagent gen AI systems, including tools that can help organizations build their own custom agents.[31](#endnote-31)\\n\\n![](/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\\n\\n## Promising use cases for autonomous gen AI agents\\n\\nBig tech companies and startups are developing early-stage solutions that can partially automate functions like software development, sales, marketing, and regulatory compliance. What follows is a snapshot of today’s examples, not an exhaustive list of applications. Some are based on proofs of concept and demos that are promising but are not ready for enterprise deployment. While these examples are cross-industry, industry-specific agentic applications are also emerging.\\n\\n**Customer support:** Customer service is an essential—and often stressful—job, with an annual turnover rate of 38%.[32](#endnote-32) Effective automation of parts of the customer support workflow could reduce stress and tedium for staff, and help companies serve more customers.[33](#endnote-33) Agentic AI can handle more complex customer inquiries than today’s customer support chatbots, and they can act autonomously to resolve issues. In one example, an audio company is using agentic AI to help customers set up new equipment, a multistep process that usually requires a human agent. If a human agent is required, the agentic AI compiles relevant information and summarizes the issue before transferring the customer.[34](#endnote-34) The next wave of customer support agents will likely integrate multimodal data such as voice and video in addition to text-based chat.\\n\\n**Cybersecurity:** Cybersecurity experts epitomize the shortage of skilled knowledge workers: Globally, there’s a shortfall of four million today.[35](#endnote-35) Meanwhile, malicious actors are using gen AI to infiltrate cybersecurity systems. Emerging agentic cybersecurity systems can make human experts more efficient by automating aspects of their work. They can autonomously detect attacks and generate reports, improving system security and reducing the workload of human experts by up to 90%.[36](#endnote-36) Agentic AI can also help software development teams detect vulnerabilities in new code. It can run tests and communicate directly with developers to explain how to fix a problem—something human engineers must do manually today.[37](#endnote-37)\\n\\n**Regulatory compliance:** Companies across industries, including financial services and healthcare, are required to conduct periodic regulatory compliance reviews. The increased size and complexity of relevant regulations, and the dearth of compliance professionals, makes compliance a growing challenge. Startups are developing agentic AI that can analyze regulations and corporate documents, and quickly determine whether the company is compliant. The agent can cite specific regulations, and proactively provide analysis and advice to human regulatory professionals.[38](#endnote-38) Companies that use gen AI today cite regulatory compliance as their top barrier to developing and deploying gen AI, ahead of issues like a lack of AI technical talent, and implementation challenges.[39](#endnote-39) Regulatory uncertainty plays a role, but so does the reach and complexity of new regulations. By helping companies understand and comply with regulations as they’re enacted, a more agentic AI solution could help accelerate wider gen AI adoption across enterprises.\\n\\n**Agent builders and orchestrators:** Agentic AI solutions are emerging to help automate other cross-industry and vertical-specific workflows. Companies may not need to wait for the market, however. They can build their own agents and multiagent systems. With Google’s Vertex, companies can use no-code tools to create agents for specific tasks, such as building marketing collateral based on previous marketing campaigns.[40](#endnote-40) LangChain uses open-source technology to help companies construct multiagentic systems. For example, startup Paradigm has launched a “smart spreadsheet” in which multiple agentic AIs partner to collect data from diverse sources, structure it, and complete tasks.[41](#endnote-41)\\n\\n![](/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\\n\\n## Bottom line\\n\\nAgentic AI has enormous potential to help increase the productivity of knowledge workers by automating entire workflows and discrete tasks. Its ability to take independent action, as single agents or in concert with other agents, sets it apart from today’s chatbots and co-pilots. Yet, agentic AI is in the early stages of development and adoption. As impressive as early agentic examples may be, these agents can make mistakes and get stuck in loops. In multiagent systems, “hallucinations” can spread from one agent to another; they can persuade other agents to take the wrong steps and give incorrect answers.[42](#endnote-42) Although agentic AI can be mainly autonomous, often having a human review decisions after they’ve been made (also known as “human on the loop” rather than the more restrictive “human in the loop”) can make agentic AI more suitable for deployment today. When gen AI agents get stuck, they can consult human experts who help them resolve the challenge and move forward. In this model, agentic AI is like a junior employee who can learn by experience while performing valuable work.[43](#endnote-43)\\n\\n![](/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\\n\\nBecause the vision for agentic AI is compelling and the technology is evolving rapidly, companies should prepare themselves now.\\n\\n![](/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\\n\\nWhile some companies are investing billions to create consistent and reliable agentic AI, it’s not clear when this will happen, or under what circumstances. Will agentic AI reach widespread adoption in 2025, or within the next five years? Will ubiquity require breakthrough innovation, or tweaking current AI technologies and training methods? If the big companies and startups developing agentic AI are successful, the game will change quickly. Imagine autonomous gen AI agents that can process multimodal data, use tools, orchestrate other agents, remember and learn, and execute tasks consistently and reliably. Imagine further that custom agents can be quickly and easily developed by enterprises in “no-code environments” using just conversational text prompts.\\n\\nBecause the vision for agentic AI is compelling and the technology is evolving rapidly, companies should prepare themselves now. As they prepare, they should consider the following approaches.\\n\\n**Prioritize and redesign workflows for agentic AI:** Consider which tasks and workflows are well-suited for agentic AI to execute, based on the technology’s capabilities and where the highest value is for your company. Redesign them to remove unnecessary steps. Ensure that agentic AI solutions have a clear goal, and access to the data, tools, and systems they will require. Although these agents can help other agents navigate their environment, cluttered and sub-optimized processes could deliver disappointing results.\\n\\n**Focus on data governance and cybersecurity:** For agentic AI to deliver value, it must have access to valuable and potentially sensitive enterprise data, as well as internal systems and external resources. Companies should put strong data governance and cybersecurity in place before getting started with autonomous generative AI agents. For gen AI early adopters, the top areas where they’re increasing IT investment are data management (75%) and cybersecurity (73%).[44](#endnote-44) Despite these investments, 58% are highly concerned about using sensitive data in models and managing data security. And only 23% say they’re highly prepared for managing gen AI risk and governance. In short, many of today’s gen AI leaders seem unprepared for the advent of agentic AI. If these leaders are not ready, companies that are still on the gen AI sidelines surely have further to go.\\n\\n**Balance risk and reward:** When starting with agentic AI, companies should consider the level of autonomy and data access agents are permitted. Low risk use cases with non-critical data and human oversight can help companies build the data management, cybersecurity, and governance for safe agentic AI applications. Once these are in place, companies should consider higher value use cases that use strategic data, access to more tools, and more autonomy.\\n\\n**Maintain healthy skepticism:** Agentic AI is evolving and will likely be more capable in the next year, and will be applied to more horizontal and vertical-specific use cases. Expect impressive demos, simulations, and product announcements throughout 2025. But the challenges we’ve noted may take some time to resolve. Until these challenges are addressed, agentic AI performance in controlled settings is unlikely to deliver improved enterprise performance. Evaluate and question carefully.\\n\\n### By\\n\\n#### Jeff Loucks\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\n### Jeff Loucks\\n\\nTech, Media & Telecom | Executive director\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\nJeff Loucks is the executive director of Deloitte\\'s Center for Technology, Media & Telecommunications, Deloitte Services LP.

According to Deloitte’s *State of Generative AI in the Enterprise* survey, 23% of enterprises that currently use gen AI are exploring “gen AI agents” to a “large” or “very large” extent, with another 42% exploring it “to some extent.” Given the high interest in agentic AI and the products and services that are being launched by startups and established tech companies, we expect this interest to turn to action, at least on an experimental scale.\\n2.

            "\n",
            "In 2023 and 2024, tech-forward enterprises broke through the pilot phase, achieving 10% to 25% EBITDA gains by scaling information retrieval and single-task AI. In doing so, they established a repeatable playbook that others can now follow—grounded in robust methodology, analytic tools, and clear benchmarks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yet a year on, most organizations remain stuck in experimentation mode, satisfied with minor productivity gains that haven’t delivered significant value. But as the leaders move forward, falling behind risks ceding competitive ground that may be difficult to recover.\n",
            "\n",
            "And things are about to get even more interesting: In the first half of 2025, major players—including Anthropic, Alphabet, Microsoft, OpenAI, Salesforce, and others—debuted their visions of agentic AI. Tech-forward enterprises are already turning their focus from automating tasks to redesigning entire workflows. Early adopters are figuring out how agents will coexist safely, discover each other, gather the context and data they need, and collaborate productively. As the vision meets reality, they’ll also wrestle with data silos, informal context, intellectual property, privacy, security, and vendor profit motives.\n",
            "\n",
            "A purist view of architecture won’t meet the moment. Given the current pace of AI innovation, the most likely scenario is that we’ll see rapid, fitful, and hard-to-predict progress. Companies should maintain an architectural North Star but sustain progress with fit-for-purpose, domain-specific, and human-in-the-loop builds for the foreseeable future.\n",

            "\n",
            "### Leaders cracked the code\n",
            "\n",
            "In our *2023 Tech Report*, we wrote about how some leaders were beginning to unlock the secrets of AI productivity (see “[You’re Out of Time to Wait and See on AI](/insights/youre-out-of-time-to-wait-and-see-on-ai-tech-report-2023/)”). In 2024, we could already see clear patterns about where AI ROI could reliably be captured (see “[Five Functions Where AI Is Already Delivering](/insights/five-functions-where-ai-is-already-delivering-tech-report-2024/)”). While transformation styles varied, these early adopters have delivered a roadmap with proven methodology, analytic tools, and benchmarks. We can summarize this roadmap with five critical actions:\n",
            "\n",
            "* Set ambitious goals based on top-down diagnostics, not trials and pilots.\n",
            "* Charge general managers with meeting these targets, not the CIO or CTO.\n",
            "* Redesign entire workflows, not siloed activities or use cases.\n",
            "* Curate and clean the data and application environment as needed, not holistically.\n",
            "* Make, buy, or partner to build capabilities for each major workflow, rather than waiting for enterprise-wide solutions.\n",
            "\n",
            "The biggest insight from these transformations is that the most important aspects of the transformation are process redesign and cleaning up the data and application environment. Because of this, it doesn’t make sense to wait for the dust to settle on technology. There’s no way to cut corners on process, data, and application cleanup. Every day a company waits is another day it’s left behind.\n",

            "### AI leaders pursue agentic AI\n",
            "\n",
            "AI innovation increasingly focuses on enabling models to work with much more complex reasoning, context, and unstructured data while communicating with SaaS applications and other agents (see Figure 1).\n",
            "\n",

            "As noted earlier, many tech giants debuted their visions of agentic AI in the first half of 2025. While flavors vary, the underlying progression of capabilities crystallizes into four levels.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Level 1:  LLM-powered information retrieval agents** (e.g., knowledge assistants, copilots)\n",
            "* **Level 2:  Single-task agentic workflows** (e.g., task-doers with self-contained action loops)\n",
            "* **Level 3:  Cross-system agentic workflow orchestration** (e.g., complex workflow execution, supervised agents)\n",
            "* **Level 4:  Multi-agent constellations** (e.g., any-to-any agent, loosely coupled collaborative agents)\n",
            "\n",
            "Tech-forward companies scaled Level 1 tools in 2023 and 2024, with varying degrees of success. When deployed in a diffuse way, they delivered microproductivity—what we might call “grab-a-coffee\" time-savers. But when deeply embedded in functional workflows in areas such as sales, development, and product management, the gains compounded—especially after heavy data cleaning and curation as well as continuous high-quality governance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Levels 2 and 3 are now where capital, innovation, and deployment velocity are converging (see Figure 2).  Level 4 is on the whiteboard, held back by several practical realities outlined in the next section.\n",

            "In 2025, leading tech companies turned their attention to making single- and multi-system workflows smarter, powered by agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "As vendors race to bring their agentic visions to life, enterprise teams face new challenges: How will these agents operate safely, find and connect with each other, gather the context and data they need, and collaborate productively as the vision meets the reality of vendor profit motives, data silos, informal context, enterprise data, IP, and security?\n",
            "\n",
            "As higher levels of agentic autonomy are pursued, enterprises are encountering a number of thorny issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Human work:** Most work happens across multiple systems and organizations, with context and informal processes.\n",
            "* **Technology gaps:** These include a lack of communication standards (Model Context Protocol, or MCP, isn’t USB) and compounding errors in multistep tasks.\n",
            "* **Enterprise reality:** Data isn’t clean, and privacy, security, and intellectual property are real concerns.\n",
            "* **Vendor motives:** These run counter to open standards, shared IP, workflows, and data, leading to battles and walled gardens.\n",
            "\n",
            "Several architectural visions exist for how higher levels of agentic autonomy can be enabled. Most call for an interconnected fabric or mesh that will register, distribute, and allow communication between agents to enable secure collaboration. Some visions are more libertarian than others, but most resemble Web 3.0: a logical vision for how things should work if no one were greedy and governance and accountability were not thorny issues. Much like Web 3.0, we expect these visions to serve as a useful aspiration, but we don’t expect them to survive contact with enterprise reality unchanged.\n",
            "\n",
            "For this reason, a rigid approach to architecture falls short of what’s needed. With AI moving at breakneck speed, progress is likely to be rapid, uneven, and tough to forecast. Walled gardens will take the lead. Fit-for-purpose custom builds will dominate enterprise-wide architectures for some time. Human-in-the-loop applications are likely the pragmatic reality for years. Context and graph analytics will remain closely guarded assets. Standards battles will play out at lightning pace (witness the MCP and Agent-to-Agent, or A2A, adoption tipping points); incumbents may try to selectively open source their IP; and domain-specific leaders will emerge.\n",

            "### Now is the moment to act\n",
            "\n",
            "Maximizing value in this next phase demands disciplined focus on a small set of high-impact priorities. The organizations that move decisively will extend their lead; those that hesitate risk being left behind.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Keep up the pace.** The critical work remains redesigning processes and workflows while cleaning and standardizing data. Any further delay compounds technical debt and makes catching up much harder.\n",
            "* **Follow the taillights of enterprise leaders.** The path forward is well-mapped. Proven playbooks, tested methodologies, advanced analytic tools, and benchmark data are already available. Focus on them to accelerate progress rather than reinventing the wheel.\n",
            "* **Take a principled but flexible view of architecture.** Expect domain-specific platforms, not one-size-fits-all enterprise systems—for example, tailored solutions for supply chain, sales, and other key domains. Plan for human-in-the-loop oversight for now—think Iron Man suits, not fully autonomous Iron Man robots. Finally, select vendors strategically to limit (or at least balance) agent lock-in and preserve optionality for future evolution.\n",

Agentic AI is different from today’s chatbots and co-pilots, which themselves are often called “agents.” Agentic AI has the potential to make knowledge workers more productive and to automate multi-step processes across business functions. Deloitte predicts that in 2025, 25% of companies that use gen AI will launch agentic AI pilots or proofs of concept, growing to 50% in 2027.[1](#endnote-1) Some agentic AI applications, in some industries, and for some use cases, could see actual adoption into existing workflows in 2025, especially by the back half of the year.\n",

But they lack the degree of agency and autonomy that agentic AI promises. While chatbots and agents share the same foundation—large language models (LLM)—additional technologies and techniques enable agents to act independently, break a job down into discrete steps, and complete their work with minimal human supervision or intervention. AI agents don’t just interact. They more effectively reason and act on behalf of the user.\n",

Co-pilots that assist software developers by testing and suggesting code are one of the most successful gen AI use cases to date.[7](#endnote-7) They can make experienced software engineers more productive and increase the effectiveness of junior coders. They can convert natural language prompts (in multiple languages) into suggestions for code, and test code for consistency. But such co-pilots only respond to prompts from engineers and do not show agency. With agentic AI, the software “engineer” takes this a step further. A human coder can enter ideas for software through a prompt, and the agentic AI “software engineer” converts those ideas into executable code, a process that automates multiple steps in the software development process.\n",

Quantifiable business value from gen AI has often been elusive, however. Challenges with data foundations, risk and governance policies, and talent gaps make it hard for companies to scale gen AI initiatives.[18](#endnote-18) Only 30% of gen AI pilots make it to full production.[19](#endnote-19) Lack of trust in gen AI output, and potential “real world” consequences from gen AI mistakes, give executives pause.[20](#endnote-20)\n",

By introducing reasoning tokens, chain-of-thought models can solve more complex challenges than previous LLMs. Chain-of-thought models are slower to respond but are more deliberative in how they reason through a problem; they can correct their own errors; and they can show the steps they have taken to reach a solution.[24](#endnote-24)\n",
            "* **Senses the environment:** Agentic AI can perceive the environment, process information, and understand the context of the tasks it is given.[25](#endnote-25) Advanced agentic AI can process multimodal data, such as videos, images, audio, text, and numbers.\n",
            "* **Uses tools:** Agentic AI interacts with tools and systems to complete tasks, such as software, enterprise applications, and the internet.\n",

            "* **Accesses memory:** LLMs are stateless: Each interaction is processed independently, and information is not retained when an interaction is complete. With the addition of retrieval mechanisms and databases, agentic AI can access short-term memory to maintain context while performing a specific task, and long-term memory to learn and improve from experience.[26](#endnote-26)\n",

In one example, an audio company is using agentic AI to help customers set up new equipment, a multistep process that usually requires a human agent. If a human agent is required, the agentic AI compiles relevant information and summarizes the issue before transferring the customer.[34](#endnote-34) The next wave of customer support agents will likely integrate multimodal data such as voice and video in addition to text-based chat.\n",

Emerging agentic cybersecurity systems can make human experts more efficient by automating aspects of their work. They can autonomously detect attacks and generate reports, improving system security and reducing the workload of human experts by up to 90%.[36](#endnote-36) Agentic AI can also help software development teams detect vulnerabilities in new code.

Startups are developing agentic AI that can analyze regulations and corporate documents, and quickly determine whether the company is compliant. The agent can cite specific regulations, and proactively provide analysis and advice to human regulatory professionals.[38](#endnote-38) Companies that use gen AI today cite regulatory compliance as their top barrier to developing and deploying gen AI, ahead of issues like a lack of AI technical talent, and implementation challenges.[39](#endnote-39) Regulatory uncertainty plays a role, but so does the reach and complexity of new regulations. By helping companies understand and comply with regulations as they’re enacted, a more agentic AI solution could help accelerate wider gen AI adoption across enterprises.\n",

Yet, agentic AI is in the early stages of development and adoption. As impressive as early agentic examples may be, these agents can make mistakes and get stuck in loops. In multiagent systems, “hallucinations” can spread from one agent to another; they can persuade other agents to take the wrong steps and give incorrect answers.[42](#endnote-42) Although agentic AI can be mainly autonomous, often having a human review decisions after they’ve been made (also known as “human on the loop” rather than the more restrictive “human in the loop”) can make agentic AI more suitable for deployment today. When gen AI agents get stuck, they can consult human experts who help them resolve the challenge and move forward. In this model, agentic AI is like a junior employee who can learn by experience while performing valuable work.[43](#endnote-43)\n",

            "While some companies are investing billions to create consistent and reliable agentic AI, it’s not clear when this will happen, or under what circumstances. Will agentic AI reach widespread adoption in 2025, or within the next five years? Will ubiquity require breakthrough innovation, or tweaking current AI technologies and training methods? If the big companies and startups developing agentic AI are successful, the game will change quickly. Imagine autonomous gen AI agents that can process multimodal data, use tools, orchestrate other agents, remember and learn, and execute tasks consistently and reliably. Imagine further that custom agents can be quickly and easily developed by enterprises in “no-code environments” using just conversational text prompts.\n",
            "\n",
            "Because the vision for agentic AI is compelling and the technology is evolving rapidly, companies should prepare themselves now. As they prepare, they should consider the following approaches.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Prioritize and redesign workflows for agentic AI:** Consider which tasks and workflows are well-suited for agentic AI to execute, based on the technology’s capabilities and where the highest value is for your company. Redesign them to remove unnecessary steps. Ensure that agentic AI solutions have a clear goal, and access to the data, tools, and systems they will require. Although these agents can help other agents navigate their environment, cluttered and sub-optimized processes could deliver disappointing results.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Focus on data governance and cybersecurity:** For agentic AI to deliver value, it must have access to valuable and potentially sensitive enterprise data, as well as internal systems and external resources. Companies should put strong data governance and cybersecurity in place before getting started with autonomous generative AI agents. For gen AI early adopters, the top areas where they’re increasing IT investment are data management (75%) and cybersecurity (73%).[44](#endnote-44) Despite these investments, 58% are highly concerned about using sensitive data in models and managing data security. And only 23% say they’re highly prepared for managing gen AI risk and governance. In short, many of today’s gen AI leaders seem unprepared for the advent of agentic AI. If these leaders are not ready, companies that are still on the gen AI sidelines surely have further to go.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Balance risk and reward:** When starting with agentic AI, companies should consider the level of autonomy and data access agents are permitted. Low risk use cases with non-critical data and human oversight can help companies build the data management, cybersecurity, and governance for safe agentic AI applications. Once these are in place, companies should consider higher value use cases that use strategic data, access to more tools, and more autonomy.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Maintain healthy skepticism:** Agentic AI is evolving and will likely be more capable in the next year, and will be applied to more horizontal and vertical-specific use cases. Expect impressive demos, simulations, and product announcements throughout 2025. But the challenges we’ve noted may take some time to resolve. Until these challenges are addressed, agentic AI performance in controlled settings is unlikely to deliver improved enterprise performance. Evaluate and question carefully.\n",
